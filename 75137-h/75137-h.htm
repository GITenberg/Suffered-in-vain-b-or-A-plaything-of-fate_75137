<p class="center">A SINGULAR WILL.</p>


<p>Always more or less subdued in tone and tranquil of
aspect, the eminently genteel Square of Porchester is,
perhaps, seen in its most benign mood in the gently falling
shadows of a summer’s twilight.</p>

<p>The tall houses begin slowly, very slowly, to twinkle
with a glowworm irradiance from the drawing-rooms to
the apartments on the upper floors as the darkness increases.
From the open windows float the glittering
strains of Gounod, Offenbach, Hervé, fluttering down
over the flower-wreathed balconies into the silent street
beneath, each succession of chords tumbling like so many
fairies intoxicated with the spirit of music. At not infrequent
intervals, sparkling broughams whirl past, carrying
ladies arrayed obviously for dinner-party, soirée, or
opera, in gay toilets, only half-concealed by the loose
folds of soft wraps.</p>

<p>At the moment the curtain rises, two persons of the
drama occupy this stage.</p>

<p>One is an individual of a peculiarly unattractive exterior—a
man of probably some two or three and thirty
years of age—a foreigner, by his appearance. It would
have been difficult to tell whether recent illness or absolute
want had made his not unhandsome face so white and
pinched, and caused the shabby garments to hang about
his tall, well-knit figure. Seemingly, he was one of those
most forlorn of creatures—a domestic servant out of
employ.</p>

<p>The expression on his countenance just now, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
leaned against the iron railings of the enclosure, almost
concealed behind a doctor’s brougham which awaited its
master, was not pleasant to regard. Following the direction
of his fixed stare, the eye was led to a superbly beautiful
woman, sitting half-within the French window of a
drawing-room opposite, half-out upon the balcony, among
some clustering flowers.</p>

<p>This woman was undoubtedly quite unconscious of the
steady attention bestowed upon her by the solitary being,
only distant from her presence by a few feet. She was
a young woman of about three-and-twenty—an Italian,
judging by her general aspect—attired in a rich costume,
lavishly trimmed with black lace. A white lace shawl,
lightly thrown over her shoulders, permitted only gracious
and flowing outlines to reveal themselves; but her supremely
lovely face, the masses of coiled and plaited
hair, dark as night, stray diamond stars gleaming here
and there, the glowing complexion, the sleepy, long, silk,
soft lashes, resting upon cheeks which might be described
as “peachlike,” the crimson lips, the delicately rounded
chin, the perfect, shell-like ears, made up an ensemble
of haunting beauty that, once seen, could never be forgotten.</p>

<p>Of the vicinity, much less of the rapt gaze of the wayfarer
lingering yonder, she was profoundly ignorant,
her attention being entirely occupied by a written sheet
of paper, held between her slender white fingers. This
she was apparently studying with absorbed interest.</p>

<p>The loiterer clenched his fist, malignant hate wrinkling
his care-worn face, and made a gesture, betraying the
most intense anger toward the imperial creature in the
amber and black draperies.</p>

<p>“So, Madam Lucia Guiscardini,” he muttered, under
his breath, “you bask up there, in your beauty and your
finery, like some sleek, treacherous cat! Beautiful signora,
if I had a pistol now, I could shoot you dead, without
leaving you a moment to think upon your sins. Your
sins! and they say you are one of the best and noblest
of women—those who do not know your cold and cruel
heart, snow-plumaged swan of Firenze! How can it be
that I could ever have loved you so wildly—that I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
have knelt down to kiss the ground upon which your
dainty step had trod? Were you the same—was I the
same? Has all the world changed since those days?</p>

<p>“I have suffered cold and hunger, sickness and pain,
weariness of body, anguish of mind, while you have been
lapped in luxury. You have been gently borne about in
your carriage, wrapped in velvets and furs, or satins and
laces, while I—I have passed through the rain-sodden
streets with scarcely a shoe to my foot. They say you
refused, in your pride, to marry a Russian prince the
other day. All the world marveled at your insolent
caprice. I wonder what you think of me, or if you ever
honor me with a flying recollection? Am I the one drop
of gall in your cup of nectar, or have you forgotten me?”</p>

<p>A quick, firm step startled the tranquil echoes of the
square, and made this fellow glance about with the vague
sense of ever-recurring alarm which poverty and distress
engender in those unaccustomed to the companionship of
such dismal comrades.</p>

<p>The instant he descried the person approaching, his
countenance changed. He cast down his fierce, keen
eyes, and an expression of humility replaced the glare
of vindictive bitterness that had previously rendered his
visage anything but pleasant to look upon.</p>

<p>This third personage of the drama was one, in appearance,
worthy to take the part of hero. He was, perhaps,
about thirty years old, with a noble presence, a fair and
frank face, though one clouded by a strange shadow of
mysterious care ever brooding. The face attracted at
once, and inspired a wish to know something more of
the soul looking through those bright, half-sadly smiling
violet eyes as from the windows of a prison.</p>

<p>The forlorn watcher next the iron railings left his post
of stealthy observation on seeing this gentleman, and,
crossing, so as to intercept him, stood in the middle of
the pavement in such a way as to abruptly bar the passage.</p>

<p>The large kindly eyes, which had been cast down, as
if indifferent to all outward things, and engaged in painful
introspection, were suddenly raised with a flash of
displeased surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“Sir,” began the poor lounger deprecatingly, half-unconsciously
clasping his meager hands, and speaking almost
in the voice of a supplicant, “Captain Desfrayne,
forgive me for daring to address you; but——”</p>

<p>“You are a stranger to me, although you seem acquainted
with my name,” the gentleman said, scanning
him with a keen glance. “I don’t know that I have ever
seen you before. What do you want? By your accent,
you appear to be an Italian.”</p>

<p>“I am so, captain. I did not know you were coming
this way, nor did I know you were in London. I have
only this moment seen you, as you turned into the square;
or I—I thought—for I know you, though perhaps you
may never have noticed me—I knew of old that you have
a kind and tender heart, and I thought—— Sir, I am a
bad hand at begging; but I am sorely, bitterly in need of
help.”</p>

<p>“Of help?” repeated Captain Desfrayne, still looking at
him attentively. “Of what kind of help?”</p>

<p>Those bright eyes saw, although he asked the question,
that the man required succor in any and in every shape.</p>

<p>“Sir, when I knew you, about three years ago, I was
in the service of the Count di Venosta, at Padua, as
valet.”</p>

<p>“I knew the count well, though I have no recollection
of you,” said Captain Desfrayne. “Go on.”</p>

<p>“He died about a year and a half ago. I nursed him
through his last illness, and caught the fever of which
he died. I had a little money—my savings—to live on
for a while; but all is gone now, and I don’t know which
way to turn, or whither to look for another situation. It
was with the hope of finding some friends that I came
to London; I might as well be in the Great Desert.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt your story is perfectly true; but I
don’t see what I can do for you,” Captain Desfrayne
said, with some pity. “However, I will consider, and, if
you like to come and see me to-morrow, perhaps I——
What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Leonardo Gilardoni, sir.”</p>

<p>The hungry, eager eyes watched as Captain Desfrayne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
took a note-book from his pocket and scribbled down the
name, adding a brief memorandum besides.</p>

<p>The sound of these men’s voices speaking just beneath
her window had failed to attract the attention of the
beautiful creature in the balcony. But now, when a
sudden silence succeeded, she looked over from an undefined
feeling of half-unconscious interest or curiosity.</p>

<p>As she glanced carelessly down at the two figures, the
expression on her face utterly changed. The great eyes,
the hue of black velvet, opened widely, as if from terror,
or an astonishment too stupendous to be controlled. For
a moment she seemed unable to withdraw her gaze, fascinated,
apparently.</p>

<p>The little white hands were fiercely clenched; and if
glances could kill, those two men would have rapidly
traversed the valley of the shadow of death.</p>

<p>Fortunately, glances, however baleful, fall harmless as
summer lightning; and the interlocutors remained happily
ignorant of the absorbed attention wherewith they
were favored.</p>

<p>In a moment or two she rose, and, standing just within
the room, clutching the curtain with a half-convulsive
grip, peered down malevolently into the street.</p>

<p>“What can have brought these two men here together?”
she muttered. “Do they come to seek me? I did not
know they were conscious of one another’s existence.
What are they doing? Why are they here? Accursed
be the day I ever saw the face of either!”</p>

<p>The visage, so wondrously beautiful in repose, looked
almost hideous thus distorted by fury.</p>

<p>She saw Captain Desfrayne put his little note-book
back in his pocket, and then heard him say:</p>

<p>“If you will come to me about—say, six or seven
o’clock to-morrow evening, at my chambers in”—she
missed the name of the street and the number, though
she craned her white throat forward eagerly—“I will
speak further to you. Do not come before that time, as
I shall be absent all day.”</p>

<p>With swift, compassionate fingers he dropped a piece
of gold into the thin hand of the unhappy, friendless man
before him, and then moved, as if to continue his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>The superb creature above craned out her head as far
as she dared, to watch the two. Captain Desfrayne, however,
seemed to be the personage she was specially desirous
of following with her keen glances. To her amazement
and evident consternation, he walked up to the immediately
adjacent house, and rang the bell. The door
opened, and he disappeared.</p>

<p>The shabby, half-slouching figure of the supplicant for
help shuffled off in the other direction, toward Westbourne
Grove, and vanished from out the square.</p>

<p>Releasing her grip of the draperies hanging by the
window, the proud and insolent beauty began walking up
and down the room, flinging away the paper from which
she had been studying.</p>

<p>She looked like some handsome tigress, cramped up in
a gilded cage, as she paced to and fro, her dress trailing
along the carpet in rich and massive folds. Some almost
ungovernable fit of passion appeared to have seized upon
her, and she gave way to her impulses as a hot, undisciplined
nature might yield.</p>

<p>There was a strange kind of contrast between the feline
grace of her movements, the faultless elegance of
her perfect toilet, the splendor of her beauty, and the
untutored violence of her manner.</p>

<p>“What do they want here?” she asked, half-aloud.
“Why do they come here, plotting under my windows?
Do they defy me? Do they hope to crush me? What
has Paul Desfrayne to complain of? I defy him, as I
do Leonardo Gilardoni! Let them do their worst!
What are they going to do? Has Leonardo Gilardoni
found any—any——”</p>

<p>She started back and looked round with a guilty terror,
as if she dared not think out the half-spoken surmise
even to herself.</p>

<p>“He knows nothing—he can know nothing; and he
has no longer any hold on me,” she muttered presently;
“unless—unless the other has told him; and I don’t believe
he would trust a fellow like <i>him</i>: for Paul Desfrayne
is as proud as Lucifer. Oh, if I could but live
my life over again! What mistakes—what fatal mistakes
I have made—mistakes which may yet bring ruin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
as their fruit! I will leave England to-morrow. I don’t
care what they say, or think, or what loss it may cost
to myself or any one else. Yet, am I safer elsewhere? I
know not. What would be the consequences if they
could prove I had done what I have done? I know not;
I have never had the courage to ask.”</p>

<p>Totally unconscious of the vicinity of this beautiful,
vindictive woman, Captain Desfrayne tranquilly passed
into the house which he had come to visit.</p>

<p>“Can I see Mrs. Desfrayne?” he inquired of the smart
maid servant who answered his summons.</p>

<p>“I will see, sir. She was at dinner, sir, and I don’t
think she has gone out yet.”</p>

<p>The beribboned and pretty girl, throwing open the
door of a room at hand, and ushering the visitor within,
left him alone, while she flitted off in search of the lady
for whom he had asked, not, however, without taking a
sidelong glance at his handsome face before she disappeared.</p>

<p>The apartment was a long dining-room, extending
from the front to the back of the house, furnished amply,
yet with a certain richness, the articles being all of old
oak, carved elaborately, which lent a somber, somewhat
stately effect. It was obviously, however, a room in a
semifashionable boarding-house.</p>

<p>In a few minutes a lady opened the door, and entered
with the joyous eagerness of a girl.</p>

<p>A graceful, dignified woman, in reality seventeen years
older than Captain Desfrayne, but who looked hardly
five years his senior, of the purest type of English matronly
beauty. She seemed like one of Reynolds’ or
Gainsborough’s most exquisite portraits warmed into life,
just alighted from its canvas. The soft, blond hair, the
clear, roselike complexion, the large, half-melting violet
eyes, the smiling mouth, with its dimples playing at hide-and-seek,
the perfectly chiseled nose, the dainty, rounded
chin, the patrician figure, so classically molded that it
drew away attention from the fact that every little detail
of the apparently little-studied yet careful toilet was finished
to the most refined nicety—these hastily noted points<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
could scarce give any conception of the almost dazzling
loveliness of Paul Desfrayne’s widowed mother.</p>

<p>She entered with a light, quick step, and being met
almost as she crossed the threshold by her visitor, she
raised her white hands, sparkling with rings, and drew
down his head with an ineffably tender and loving touch.</p>

<p>“My boy—my own Paul,” she half-cooed, kissing his
forehead. “This is, indeed, an unexpected pleasure. I
did not even know that you were in London.”</p>

<p>For a moment the young man seemed about to return
his mother’s caress; but he did not do so.</p>

<p>She crossed to the window, and placing a second chair,
as she seated herself, desired Paul to take it.</p>

<p>There was a positive pleasure in observing the movements
of this perfectly graceful woman. She seemed the
embodiment of a soft, sweet strain of music; every gesture,
every fold of her draperies was at once so natural,
yet so absolutely harmonious, that it was impossible to
suggest an alteration for the better.</p>

<p>“I supposed you to be settled for a time in Paris,” Mrs.
Desfrayne said, as her son did not appear inclined to take
the lead in the impending dialogue, but accepted his chair
in almost moody silence.</p>

<p>“I should have written to you, mother; but I thought
I should most probably arrive as soon, or perhaps even
precede my letter,” replied Captain Desfrayne.</p>

<p>“You look anxious and a little worried. Has unpleasant
business brought you back? You have not obtained
the appointment to the French embassy for which you
were looking?”</p>

<p>“No. I am anxious, undoubtedly; but I suppose I
ought not to say I am worried, though I find myself
placed in a most remarkable, and—what shall I say?—delicate
position. Yesterday I received a letter, and I
came at once to consult you, with the hope that you
might be able to give me some good advice. I fear I
have called at rather an unreasonable hour?”</p>

<p>A tenderly reproachful glance seemed to assure him
that no hour could be unreasonable that brought his
ever-welcome presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>“I will advise you to the best of my ability, my dear,”
Mrs. Desfrayne smilingly said. “What has happened?”</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne drew a letter from the pocket of the
light coat which he had thrown over his evening dress,
and looked at it for a moment or two in silence, as if at
a loss how to introduce its evidently embarrassing contents.</p>

<p>His mother watched him with undisguised anxiety, her
brilliant eyes half-veiled by the blue-veined lids.</p>

<p>“This letter,” Paul at length said, “is from a legal
firm. It refers to a person whom I had some difficulty
in recalling to mind, and places me in a most embarrassing
position toward another person whom I have never
seen.”</p>

<p>“A situation certainly indicating a promise of some
perplexity,” Mrs. Desfrayne half-laughingly remarked.</p>

<p>“Some years ago,” Paul continued, “there lived an old
man—he was an iron-dealer originally, or something of
that sort—a person in a very humble rank of life; but
somehow he contrived to make an enormous fortune.
He has, in fact, left the sum of nearly three hundred
thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>“To you?” demanded Mrs. Desfrayne, in a thrilling
tone, not as if she believed such to be the case; for her
son’s accent scarcely warranted such an assumption; but
as if the wish was father to the thought.</p>

<p>Paul shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not to me—to some young girl he took an interest in,
as far as I can understand. I happened to render him a
slight service—I hardly remembered it now—some insignificant
piece of civility or kindness. It seems he entertained
a great respect for me, and attributed the rise
of his wealth to me. This young girl—I don’t know
whether she was related to him or not—has been left the
sole, or nearly the sole, inheritor of his money, and
I——”</p>

<p>“And you, Paul?”</p>

<p>“Have been nominated her trustee and sole executor
by his will. I believe he has bequeathed me some few
thousands, as a remuneration for my trouble.”</p>

<p>The slight tinge of pinky color on the cheeks of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
beautiful Mrs. Desfrayne deepened visibly, although she
sat with her back to the window.</p>

<p>“How old is the young lady?” she asked, in a subdued
tone.</p>

<p>“Eighteen or nineteen.”</p>

<p>“Is she—has she any father or mother?”</p>

<p>“Both are dead. She is, I understand, alone in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen her?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what she is like?”</p>

<p>“I am as ignorant of everything concerning her, personally,
as you are yourself, mother.”</p>

<p>“Is she pretty?”</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne’s face hardened almost to sternness
and his eyes drooped.</p>

<p>“I have already told you, mother mine, that I know
nothing whatever about her. If you will take the trouble
to glance over this letter, you will learn as much as I
know myself. I have nothing more to tell you than what
is written therein.”</p>

<p>The dainty fingers trembled slightly as they were
quickly stretched forth to receive the missive, which Paul
took from its legal-looking envelope.</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne ran rapidly over the contents, and
then read it through more slowly a second time.</p>

<p>It purported to be from Messrs. Salmon, Joyner &amp;
Joyner, the eminent firm of solicitors in Alderman’s
Lane, and requested Captain Desfrayne to favor them
with a call at his earliest convenience, as they wished to
go over the will of Mr. Vere Gardiner, iron-founder,
lately deceased, who had appointed him—Captain Desfrayne—sole
trustee to the chief legatee, an orphan girl
of nineteen, sole executor to the estate, which was valued
at about two hundred and sixty thousand pounds, and
legatee to the amount of ten thousand pounds. The
letter added that Mr. Vere Gardiner had expressed a profound
respect for Captain Desfrayne, and had several
times declared that he owed his uprise in life to a special
act of kindness received from him.</p>

<p>“How very extraordinary!” Mrs. Desfrayne softly exclaimed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
at length. “He scarcely knew you, yet trusts
this young girl and her large fortune to your sole charge.
Flattering, but, as you say, embarrassing. Two hundred
and sixty thousand pounds!” she murmured. “A girl
of nineteen. If she is a beauty”—she slightly shrugged
her dimpled shoulders—“your position will be an onerous
one, indeed.”</p>

<p>“They might as well have asked me to play keeper to a
white elephant,” the young man said, with some acerbity.
“I will have nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p>“Do not be too hasty. Probably this person had good
reason for what he has done. Besides, you would be
foolish to refuse so handsome a present as you are promised;
for we cannot conceal from ourselves that ten thousand
pounds would be a very acceptable gift.”</p>

<p>“If a free one, yes; if burdened with unpleasant conditions,
why, there might be difference of opinion. I had
almost made up my mind to decline at once and for all;
but I thought it would be more prudent to consult you
first.”</p>

<p>“My dear Paul, I feel—I will not say flattered, but I
thank you very much for your kind estimation of my
judgment. All I can say is: Go and see what these
lawyers have to say. Then, if they do not succeed in
inducing you to receive the trust, see the girl, and judge
for yourself what would be best. Perhaps she has no
friend but you, and she might run the risk of losing her
fortune. Perhaps she is sorely in need of some protector—perhaps
even of money. Where does she live?”</p>

<p>“As I told you before,” Captain Desfrayne replied, with
more asperity than seemed at all necessary under the
circumstances, “I did not know even of her existence
before receiving that letter, and I now know not one
solitary fact more than you do. I know nothing of the
girl, or of her money. I do not wish to know; I take
no interest, and I don’t want to take any interest now, or
in the future.”</p>

<p>“But it is foolish to refuse to perform a duty when
you are so entirely ignorant of the reasons why this
money has been thrown into your keeping,” urged Mrs.
Desfrayne gently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“If I refuse, I suppose the Court of Chancery will find
somebody more capable, and certainly may easily find
some one more willing than myself,” Captain Desfrayne
said, almost irritably.</p>

<p>“If it had been a boy, instead of a girl, would you have
been so reluctant?” asked Mrs. Desfrayne, smiling mischievously.</p>

<p>“That has nothing to do with it. I have to deal with
the matter as it now exists, not as it might have been.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne glanced at her son from beneath the
long, silken lashes that half-concealed her great blue
eyes. It seemed so strange to hear that musical voice,
which for nine-and-twenty or thirty years had been as
soft and sweet to her ears, as if incapable of one jangled
note, fall into that odd, irritable discordance.</p>

<p>Paul was out of sorts and out of humor, she could see.
Was he telling her <i>all</i> the truth?</p>

<p>Never, in all those years of his life, most of which
had passed under her own vision, had he uttered, looked,
or even seemed to harbor one thought that he was not
ready and willing for his mother to take cognizance of.
Why, then, this possible reticence, blowing across their
lifelong confidence like the bitter northeast wind ruffling
over clear water, turning its surface into a fragile
veil of ice?</p>

<p>The young man was out of humor, for his meeting with
the fellow whom he had just encountered almost on the
threshold of the house had brought up many recollections
he would fain have banished—memories of a time he
would gladly have erased from the pages of his life—a
time whereof his mother knew nothing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne, however, shot very wide of the mark
when she ascribed his alteration of look and manner to
some foreknowledge of the girl in question. He spoke
nothing but the truth in saying that he had never as much
as heard of her before receiving the letter that lay
between his mother’s fingers.</p>

<p>With the electric sympathy of strong mutual affection,
Paul Desfrayne quickly perceived the ill effect his coldness
had upon his mother; and with an effort he cleared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
his countenance, and assumed a shadow of his formerly
smiling aspect. He looked down, and appeared to consider.
Then, raising his eyes to those of his mother, he
said, with an air of resignation:</p>

<p>“I suppose it would be best to see the lawyers, and
hear what they have to say. It is a most intolerable
bore. I don’t know what I have done to merit being
visited for my sins in this fashion.”</p>

<p>“You don’t remember what you happened to do for
this eccentrically disposed old man?”</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“A remarkably simple matter, when all is said and
done. I was traveling once with him, as well as I can
remember, and he began talking to me about some wonderful
invention he had just brought to perfection. He
was in what I supposed to be rather cramped circumstances,
though not an absolutely poor man, for he was
traveling first-class. I should not have thought about
him at all, only, with the enthusiasm of an inventor, he
persisted in bothering me about this thing.</p>

<p>“I thought at the time it was deserving of notice; and
when he alighted, I happened to almost tumble into the
arms of the very man who had it in his power to get the
affair into use and practise. More to get rid of him than
for any more worthy motive, I introduced the two to
each other. It was something this old Vere Gardiner
had invented, for some kind of machinery, which, if
adopted by the government, would save—I really forget
how much. I recollect asking this friend, some time
after, if he had done anything about it, and he told me
it would probably make the fortune of half a dozen
people. He seemed delighted with the old man and his
invention.</p>

<p>“This must be the service he made so much of. It was
a service costing me just five or six sentences. I did
not even stop to see what Percival, this friend, thought
of old Gardiner, or what he thought of Percival; but left
them talking together in the waiting-room, for I was in
a desperate hurry to reach you, mother. I never anticipated
hearing of the affair again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>There was a brief silence.</p>

<p>“This man, it is to be presumed, was of humble birth,”
said Mrs. Desfrayne. “It will be too dreadful if, with
the irony of blind fate, this girl proves unpresentable.
In that case—at nineteen—it will be too late to mend
her manners, or her education. Perhaps she has some
frightfully appalling cognomen, which will render it a
martyrdom to present her in society. If she is anything
of a hobgoblin, you may with justice talk of a white
elephant.”</p>

<p>“I suppose there is no clause in the criminal code
whereby I may be compelled to accept the trust if I do
not elect voluntarily to undertake it?” Captain Desfrayne
asked, with a slight smile at his mother’s fastidious alarm.
“And if she is nineteen now, I suppose my responsibility
would cease in two years?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. Some crotchety old men make very singular
wills. I wonder how it happened that he had no
business friend in whom he could confide?—why he must
choose a stranger, and entrust to that stranger such a
large sum? I wish I knew what the girl’s name is, and
what she is like, and what possible position she may
occupy? For if you receive the trust, I presume I shall
have the felicity of playing the part of chaperon.”</p>

<p>“It is perfectly useless discussing the matter until we
know something more certain,” Captain Desfrayne said,
his irritation again displaying itself unaccountably.</p>

<p>“One cannot help surmising, my dearest Paul. Perhaps
the girl is a nursemaid, or a milliner’s apprentice,
and misuses her aspirates, and is a budding Malaprop,”
Mrs. Desfrayne persisted. “However, we shall see. Go
with me this evening to the opera, if you have nothing
better to do. Lady Quaintree has lent me her box.”</p>

<p>As she was folding her opera-cloak about her youthful-looking
person the good lady said to herself:</p>

<p>“There is some mystery here; but of what kind? Paul
is not quite his own frank self. What has happened?
He has kept something from me. I could not help fancying
something occurred during his absence in Venice three
years ago. I wonder if he knows more about this girl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
the fortunate legatee of the eccentric old iron-founder,
than he chooses to acknowledge? But he must have
some most powerful reason to induce him to hide anything
from me; and he said twice most distinctly that he
had never seen her and did not know her name. I do
not believe Paul could be guilty of deceit.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">CAPTAIN DESFRAYNE’S PERPLEXITY.</p>


<p>The midday sun made an abortive effort to struggle
down between the tall rows of houses on either side of
busy, hurrying Alderman’s Lane, glinting here and glancing
there, showering royal largesse.</p>

<p>The big building devoted to the offices of Messrs. Salmon,
Joyner &amp; Joyner was lying completely bathed in
the golden radiance; for it occupied the corner, where
the opening of a street running transverse allowed the
glorious beams to descend unimpeded.</p>

<p>A great barracklike edifice, more like a bank than a
lawyer’s city abode. A wide flight of steps led up to a
handsome swing door, on which a brightly burnished plate
blazoned forth the name of the firm. This opened upon
an oblong hall, in which were posted two doleful-looking
boys, each immured in a kind of walled-off cell; a spacious
staircase ran from this hall to a succession of
small, cell-like apartments, all furnished in as frugal a
manner as was compatible with use; a long table, covered
with piles of papers of various descriptions; three or
four hard chairs; a bookcase crammed with tall books
bound in vellum, and morose-looking tin deed-boxes labeled
with names.</p>

<p>In one of these dim, uninviting cells sat a gentleman,
apparently quite at ease, his employment at the moment
the scene draws back and reveals him to view being the
leisurely perusal of the <i>Times</i>; a man of perhaps the
same age as Captain Desfrayne—a pleasant, grave-looking
gentleman, with kindly dark eyes, a carefully trimmed
dark-brown beard, a pale complexion, and a symmetrical
figure.</p>

<p>One of the melancholy walled-in youths suddenly appeared
to disturb the half-dreamy studies of this serene
personage.</p>

<p>Throwing open the door, he announced:</p>

<p>“Captain Desfrayne.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>The captain walked in, and the door was shut.</p>

<p>The occupant of the apartment had risen as the youth
ushered in the visitor, and advanced the few steps the
limited space permitted, smiling with a peculiarly winning
expression.</p>

<p>“Mr. Amberley?” questioned Captain Desfrayne.</p>

<p>“I have called,” he went on, as the owner of that name
bowed assentingly, “in obedience to a letter received by
me from Messrs. Salmon, Joyner &amp; Joyner.”</p>

<p>He threw upon the table the letter he had shown to
his mother, and then seated himself, as Mr. Amberley
signed for him to do.</p>

<p>Mr. Amberley, in spite of the latent smile in his dark
eyes, seemed to be a man inclined to let other people
save him the trouble of talking if they felt so disposed.
He took up the letter, extracted it from its envelope, and
unfolded it.</p>

<p>“Mr. Salmon and Mr. Willis Joyner wished to meet
you, together with myself,” he remarked, “but were
obliged to attend another appointment. In the meantime,
before you can see them, I shall be happy to afford you
all necessary explanations.”</p>

<p>“Which I very much need, for I am unpleasantly mystified.
In the first place, I am at a loss to comprehend
why this client of yours should have selected me as the
person to whom he chose to confide so vast a trust,” Captain
Desfrayne replied, in a tone almost bordering on ill
humor.</p>

<p>“I am quite aware of the fact that you were not a
personal friend of Mr. Vere Gardiner,” said the lawyer.
“He trusted scarcely any one. I believe he entertained
a painfully low estimate of the goodness or honesty of
the majority of people. Of his particular object in giving
this property into your care, I am unable to enlighten
you. I know that he took a great interest in you; and
as he frequently sojourned in the places where you happened
to be staying, I have no doubt he had every opportunity
of becoming acquainted with as much as he
wished to learn of—of—— In fact, I have no grounds
beyond such observations as may have been made before
me for judging that he did take an interest in you. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
you are surprised by the circumstance of his appointing
you to such a post, I think you will probably be infinitely
more so when you hear the contents of the will.”</p>

<p>He rose, and took from an iron safe a piece of folded
parchment, which he spread open before him on his
desk.</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne said nothing, but eyed the portentous
document with an odd glance.</p>

<p>“The history of this will is perhaps a curious one,” Mr.
Frank Amberley resumed. “Mr. Vere Gardiner was,
when a young man, very deeply attached to a young person
in his own rank of life, whom he wished to marry.
She, however, preferred another, and refused the offers
of Mr. Gardiner. He never married. In a few years
she was left a widow. He again renewed his offer, and
was again refused. He was very urgent; and, to avoid
him, she changed her residence several times. The consequence
was, he lost sight of her. He became a wealthy
man, chiefly, he always declared, through your instrumentality.
After this he found this person—when he
had, so to speak, become a man of fortune—again renewed
his offer of marriage, and was again refused as
firmly as before. She had one child, a daughter.”</p>

<p>The lawyer turned to look for some papers, which he
did not succeed in finding, and, having made a search,
turned back again.</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne made no remark whatever.</p>

<p>“He offered to do anything, or to help this Mrs. Turquand
in any way she would allow him: to put the child
to school, or—— In fact, his offers were most generous.
But she persistently shunned him, and refused to
listen to anything he had to say. He lost sight of her for
some years before his death, and did not even know
whether she was living or dead.</p>

<p>“It was accidentally through—through me,” the lawyer
continued, speaking with a visible effort, as if somewhat
overmastered by an emotion inexplicable under the
circumstances—“it was through me that he learned of
the death of the mother and the whereabouts of the
daughter.”</p>

<p>“The latter being, I presume, the young lady whom he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
has been kind enough to commit to my care?” Captain
Desfrayne asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Amberley twirled an ivory paper-cutter about for
a moment or two before replying.</p>

<p>“Precisely so. I happen to be acquainted with—with
the young lady; and he one day mentioned her name,
and said how anxious he was to find her. I volunteered
to introduce her to him; but he was then ill, and the
interview was deferred. He went to Nice, the place
where Mrs. Turquand had died, and drew his last breath
in the very house where she had been staying. In accordance
with his dying wishes, he was buried close by
the spot where she was laid. The will was drawn up a
few weeks before he quitted England.”</p>

<p>“I certainly wish he had selected any one rather than
myself for this onerous trust,” Captain Desfrayne said,
with some irritation. “What is the young lady’s name?
Miss Turquand?”</p>

<p>Mr. Amberley hesitated, took up the will, and laid it
down again; then took it up, and placed it before Captain
Desfrayne.</p>

<p>“If you will read that, you will learn all you require
to know,” he replied, without looking up.</p>

<p>He had been perfectly right in remarking that, if Captain
Desfrayne had felt surprised before, he would be
doubly astonished when he came to read Mr. Vere Gardiner’s
will.</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne was fairly astounded, and could
scarcely believe that he read aright. The sum of two
hundred and sixty thousand pounds was left, divided
equally into two portions, but burdened largely with restrictions.</p>

<p>One hundred and thirty thousand pounds was bequeathed
to Lois Turquand, a minor, spinster. Until
she reached the age of twenty-one, however, she was to
receive only the annual income of two thousand pounds.</p>

<p>The second half—one hundred and thirty thousand
pounds—was left to Paul Desfrayne, Captain in his majesty’s
One Hundred and Tenth Regiment, he being appointed
also sole trustee, in the event of his being willing
to marry the aforesaid Lois Turquand when she reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
the age of twenty-one. In case the aforesaid Lois Turquand
refused to marry him, he was to receive fifty thousand
pounds; if he refused to marry her, he was to have
ten thousand pounds. If they married, the sum of two
hundred and sixty thousand pounds was to be theirs;
if not, the money forfeited by the non-compliance with
this matrimonial scheme was to be distributed in equal
portions among certain London hospitals, named one by
one.</p>

<p>Three thousand pounds was left to be divided among
the managers of departments and persons in positions of
trust in the employ of the firm; one thousand among the
clerks in the office, and five hundred among the domestics
in his service at the time of his death.</p>

<p>In the event of the demise of Lois Turquand before attaining
the age of twenty-one, Paul Desfrayne was to
receive a clear sum of one hundred and thirty thousand
pounds; the other moiety to be divided among the London
hospitals named.</p>

<p>Mr. Amberley was closely regarding Captain Desfrayne
as the latter read this will—to him so singular—once,
twice. When Captain Desfrayne at length raised his
head, however, Mr. Amberley’s glance was averted, and
he was gazing calmly through the murky window at the
radiant blue summer sky.</p>

<p>For some minutes Captain Desfrayne was unable to
speak.</p>

<p>“It is the will of a lunatic!” he at length impatiently
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Of a man as fully in possession of his senses as you
or I,” calmly replied Mr. Amberley. “You do not seem
to relish the manner in which he has claimed your services.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think—what to say. I wish he
had selected any one rather than myself, which you will
say is ingratitude, seeing how magnificently he has offered
to reward me. When shall I be obliged to go through
an interview with the young lady?”</p>

<p>“Whenever you please—this afternoon, if convenient
to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne looked at the lawyer, as if startled.
It almost seemed as if he turned pale.</p>

<p>“When, I suppose, I am to enjoy the privilege of
breaking the news?” he demanded, with a little gasp.</p>

<p>“You speak as if the prospect were anything but pleasing.
If you object to the task, it will, perhaps, be all the
better to get it done at once.”</p>

<p>“Where does she live?”</p>

<p>“She is staying with Lady Quaintree, in Lowndes
Square.”</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne recollected, with a queer feeling of
surprise, that his mother had said the previous evening
that Lady Quaintree had lent her the opera-box which
she had used. Could it be possible that his mother already
knew this girl?</p>

<p>“Lady Quaintree!” he repeated mechanically.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Miss Turquand has been living there for
two or three years; she is her ladyship’s companion. If
you have no other engagement of pressing importance,
I fancy the most easy and agreeable way would be to call
at the house this evening, about eight o’clock. Lady
Quaintree is to have some sort of reception to-night, and,
as I am almost one of the household, we could see her
before the people begin to arrive.”</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne gave way to fate. There was no help
for it, so he was obliged to agree to this arrangement, or
choose to think himself obliged, which was worse.</p>

<p>Frank Amberly thought that not many men would
have received with such obvious repugnance the position
of sole trustee to a beautiful girl of eighteen, who had
just become entitled to a splendid fortune, especially
when there were such provisions in his own favor.</p>

<p>“It is thus he receives what <i>I</i> would have given—what
would I <i>not</i> have given?—to have obtained the trust,” he
said mentally, with a keen pang of jealous envy.</p>

<p>It was a strange freak of Dame Fortune—who yet
must surely be a spiteful old maid—to bring these two
men, of all others, into such communication.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne’s thoughts were in a kind of whirl,
an entanglement which was anything but conducive to
clear deliberation or calm reflection. They eddied and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
surged with deadly fury round one great rock that reared
its cruel black crest before him, standing there in the
midst of his life, impassive, coldly menacing.</p>

<p>Hitherto, with the exception of one fatal occasion, he
had always consulted his mother on all matters of difficulty
or perplexity. But now he must carefully conceal
his real thoughts from that still beloved counselor. It
was useless to go to her, as of yore, for advice as to the
best course to take: he dared not tell her this miserable
secret which bound him in a viselike grip. His mother
would at once, he knew—unconscious that any link in the
chain was concealed from her—say he must be mad not
to accept, without hesitation, this trust. She would certainly
urge him, for the sake of this unknown girl herself.
He must decide now: it would, perhaps, only make
matters worse if he delayed, or asked time for consideration.</p>

<p>Besides, if he refused, what rational reason could he
assign to any one of those concerned for declining the
trust?</p>

<p>No; he must agree to whatever was set before him
now, although by so doing he would almost with his own
hands sow what might prove to be the most bitter harvest
in the future.</p>

<p>He was within a maze, wherein he did not at present
discern the slightest clue to guide him to the outlet of
escape. It was impossible to explain his position to any
one, yet he felt that it was next to pitiful cowardice to
march under false colors.</p>

<p>One thing was clear: if he could not explain his reasons
for declining to accept what, while somewhat eccentric,
was a fair and apparently tempting offer, he must
be ready to take the place assigned to him. Not only was
this self-evident, but also that no matter what time he
must ask for reflection, his position could not be altered,
and he could give no plausible excuse of any kind to his
mother for rejecting such princely favors.</p>

<p>“This young lady is not—is not, then, acquainted with
the contents of this will?” he asked, raising his head, and
speaking somewhat wearily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“Not as yet. We thought it best to wait until you
could yourself make the communication.”</p>

<p>He might as well face the girl now, and have it over,
as leave it to a month, six months, a year hence. He was
a soldier, yet a coward and afraid; but he shut his eyes,
as he might if ordered to fire a train, and resolved to go
through with the task, which, to any other one—taken at
random from ten thousand men—must have been a pleasant
duty.</p>

<p>The lawyer regarded him with surprise, but could not,
of course, make any remark. His wide experience had
never supplied him with a parallel case to this: of a man
receiving such rare and costly gifts from fortune with
clouded brow and half-averted eye. The hopes, however,
which had well-nigh died within his breast, of winning
the one bright jewel he coveted, revived, if feebly.</p>

<p>“There is something strangely amiss,” he thought; “but
she will be doubly, trebly shielded from the slightest risk
of harm.”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne—his troubled gaze still on the open
parchment, which he regarded as if it were his death-warrant—absolutely
started when Mr. Amberley addressed
him, after a short silence, inviting him to partake
of some wine, which magically appeared from a dim,
dusty-looking nook.</p>

<p>After a little desultory conversation, having arranged
the hour of meeting and other necessary details, Frank
Amberley observed, an odd smile lurking at the corners
of his handsome mouth:</p>

<p>“This is not the first time we have met, though you
have apparently forgotten me.”</p>

<p>The captain looked at him.</p>

<p>“I really do not remember you,” he said, with a puzzled
expression.</p>

<p>“You do not remember a certain moonlight night in
Turin, when you shot a bandit dead, as his dagger was
within five or six inches of an Englishman’s throat? Nor
an excursion which took place some weeks previously,
when you met the same compatriot in a diligence—myself,
in fact? We wrote down one another’s names, and were
going to swear an eternal friendship, when you were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
abruptly obliged to quit the city, in consequence of some
business call, or regimental duties.”</p>

<p>“The circumstances have by no means escaped my
memory,” answered Captain Desfrayne, in an indefinable
tone; “though I should have scarcely recognized you.
Since then you have a little altered.”</p>

<p>Frank Amberley, laughingly, stroked the silken beard,
which had certainly greatly changed his aspect. But the
coldness of the formerly open, frank-hearted man, whom
he had so liked three or four years ago, struck him with
deepened suspicion that something was amiss.</p>

<p>“I am glad to have met you,” he said. “I should be
very pleased if you could dine with me this evening at
the ‘London.’ My people are going out this evening, so
I am compelled to make shift as I best can, and I don’t
relish dining alone at home.”</p>

<p>A brief hesitation was ended by Paul Desfrayne accepting
this free-and-easy invitation.</p>

<p>The two young men then shook hands and parted, with
the agreement to meet again for a six-o’clock dinner.</p>

<p>Truly, times, places, and things had altered since those
days at Turin, the recollection of which seemed to bring
scant pleasure to Paul Desfrayne’s weary heart.</p>

<p>“Some fatal secret has become ingrained with that
man’s life,” said the young lawyer, as he closed the door
upon his visitor. “Great heavens! that Lois Turquand
should spurn my love, and be thrown, perhaps, into the
unwilling arms of a man like this, with such a hunted,
half-guilty look in his eyes! It shall not be—it <i>cannot</i>
be! Fate could not be so cruel!”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">LOIS TURQUAND’S EMBARRASSMENT.</p>


<p>The sun, that was shut out by towering walls from
the busy city, like some intrusive idler, was lying, half-slumbrously,
like some magnificent Eastern slave arrayed
in jewels and gold, among the brilliant-hued and many-scented
flowers heaped under the striped Venetian blinds
stretched over the balconies of a mansion in Lowndes
Square.</p>

<p>An occasional soft breeze lifted the curtains lowered
over the windows, granting a transient vision of apartments
replete with luxury, glowing under the influence
of an exquisitely delicate taste.</p>

<p>Within the principal drawing-room sat a stately matron,
with silver-white hair, attired in full evening costume,
apparently awaiting the arrival of expected guests.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree was handsome, even at sixty, with
a soft, clear skin, and a complexion girlishly brilliant; a
figure full, without being dangerously stout; a most wondrously
dainty hand, on which sparkled clusters of rings
that might have formed a king’s ransom. Her ladyship
had been a beauty in her youth—not a spoiled, ill-humored
beauty, but one kind and indulgent, much flattered and
loved, taking adoration as her due, as a queen accepts all
the rights and privileges of her position.</p>

<p>A woman made up of mild virtues—good, though not
religious; kind and pleasant, though not benevolent, abhorring
the poor, and the sick, and the unfortunate—the
very name of trouble was disagreeable to her. This world
would have been a sunny, rose-tinted Arcadia could she
have had her way; it should have been always summer.</p>

<p>She went regularly to church on Sunday morning with
great decorum, turning over the pages of her beautiful
ivory-covered church service at the proper time, and
always put sovereigns on the plate with much liberality
when there was a collection. She gave directions to her
housekeeper in the country to deal out coats, and blankets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
and all that sort of thing, to deserving applicants. If
flower-girls, or wretched-looking beggars, crowded round
her carriage when she went out shopping, they not unfrequently
received sixpences as a bribe to take themselves
and their miseries out of sight.</p>

<p>So that, altogether, her ladyship felt she had a reason
to rely on being defended from all adversities which
might happen to the body, and all evil thoughts which
might assault and hurt the soul.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree was nearly asleep when a liveried
servant drew aside the velvet portière, and announced:</p>

<p>“Captain Desfrayne and Mr. Amberley!”</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne’s glance swept the suite of apartments,
as if in search of the girl who unconsciously held the
threads of his destiny in her hands; but, to his relief, she
was not to be seen.</p>

<p>He allowed himself to be led up to the mistress of the
house, and went through the ceremony of introduction
like one in a dream. Lady Quaintree spoke to him, and
made some smiling remarks; but he was unable to do
more than reply intelligibly in monosyllables. The first
words that broke upon his half-dazed senses with anything
like clearness were uttered by Frank Amberley.</p>

<p>“Not so much, my dear aunt, to pay our respects to
you as to communicate a most important matter of business
to—to Miss Turquand. I suppose we ought to have
come at a proper hour in the business part of the day,
but it was my idea to, if possible, take off the—in fact, I
imagined it might be the most pleasant way of introducing
Captain Desfrayne to bring him here this evening.”</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree had opened her eyes at the commencement
of this speech.</p>

<p>“A most important matter of business concerning Miss
Turquand?” she said. “What can it possibly be?”</p>

<p>“She certainly ought to be the first to hear it,” replied
Frank Amberley; “though, as her nearest friend, my
dear aunt, you ought to learn the facts as soon as herself.”</p>

<p>“You have a sufficiently mysterious air, Frank. I feel
eager to hear these wonderful tidings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>Her ladyship felt a little piqued that her nephew did
not offer at once to give her at least some hint of what
the important matter of business might be about.</p>

<p>A sudden thought seemed to strike her, and she rang
a tiny, silver hand-bell with some sharpness, while an
expression of anxiety crossed her face. As she did so, a
figure, so ethereal that it seemed like an emanation of
fancy, floated unexpectedly from the entrance to the farthest
room, and came down the length of the two salons
beyond that in which the little group was stationed.</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed as if this fairylike vision had
appeared in response to the musical tingling of the bell.</p>

<p>A girl of eighteen or nineteen, dressed in the familiar
costume of Undine. A figure, tall, full of a royal dignity
and repose, like that of a statue of Diana. A face surrounded
by a radiant glory of sun-bright hair, recalling
those pure saints and martyrs which glow serenely mild
from the dim walls of old Italian or Spanish cathedrals.
Many faults might be found with that face, yet it was
one that gained in attraction at every glance.</p>

<p>The young girl advanced so rapidly down the rooms
that she was standing within a few feet of the two gentlemen
before she could plan a swift retreat.</p>

<p>A vivid, painful blush overspread her face, and she
stood as if either transformed into some beautiful sculptured
image, or absolutely unable to decide which would
be the worst of evils—to remain or to fly.</p>

<p>She turned the full luster of her translucent eyes upon
Captain Desfrayne, as some lovely wild creature of the
forest might gaze dismayed at the sight of a hunter, and
then recoiled.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree rose, and quickly moved a few steps,
as if to intercept her, and said:</p>

<p>“My dear, don’t run away. Frank Amberley knows
all about the tableau for which you are obliged to prepare.
I thought you would have come down before to
let me see how the dress suited; but I suppose that abominable
Lagrange has been late, as usual. My dear Lois, I
am dying with curiosity. These gentlemen—Captain
Desfrayne and Mr. Frank Amberley—have come to tell
you some wonderful piece of business, and I want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
know what it is as soon as possible. Pray stop. You
will only lose time if you go to change your dress.”</p>

<p>“I beseech you, madam, let me go,” pleaded Lois Turquand,
troubled by her unforeseen, embarrassing situation—strangely
troubled by the steadfast gaze which
Paul Desfrayne, in spite of himself, fixed upon her.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You must hear what they have to say.
I feel puzzled, and anxious to know.”</p>

<p>Lois vainly tried to avoid that singular, inexplicable
look, which seemed to master her. Had she not been so
suddenly taken at a disadvantage, she would have repelled
it with displeasure. As it was, she had a curious
sense of being mesmerized. She ceased to urge her entreaty
for permission to depart, and stood motionless,
though her color fluctuated every instant.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">LOIS TURQUAND’S ALTERED FORTUNE.</p>


<p>Frank Amberley looked at Captain Desfrayne, who
drew back several steps—for neither had seated himself,
although Lady Quaintree had signed to them to do so.</p>

<p>It was evident that Captain Desfrayne would not take
the initiative, so Frank Amberley was obliged to explain—more
to Lady Quaintree than to her protégée—that
Miss Turquand had been left heiress to a fortune of one
hundred and thirty thousand pounds.</p>

<p>“To just double that sum in reality; but there are certain
conditions attached to the larger amount, which must
be fulfilled, or the second moiety is forfeited,” Mr. Amberley
continued, looking down, his voice not quite so
steady as it had been when he began. “I have had a
copy of the will prepared, which Miss Turquand might
like to read before seeing the original.”</p>

<p>He had a folded paper, tied with red tape, in his hand,
which he placed on a table close by Lois. As he did so,
his eyes rested for a moment upon her with a strange,
mingled expression of passionate love and profound
despair, at once pathetic and painful.</p>

<p>The young girl still stood immovable, as if in a dream.
Her luminous eyes turned upon the document; but she
did not attempt to touch it, or show in any way that she
really comprehended what had been said, except by that
one swift glance of her eyes upon the paper.</p>

<p>“This gentleman—Captain Desfrayne—has been appointed
by Mr. Gardiner, Miss Turquand’s trustee.”</p>

<p>The brilliant eyes were turned for an instant to the
countenance of Captain Desfrayne, and then withdrawn;
while still deeper crimson tides flooded over the lovely
face.</p>

<p>“How very extraordinary!” said Lady Quaintree, as if
scarcely able to understand. “How <i>very</i> singular!” she
repeated emphatically.</p>

<p>“I am truly glad,” she cried, pulling the cloudy figure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
toward her, and kissing the fair young face. “So my little
girl is a wealthy heiress. What will you do with all
your money? Go and live in ease, and give fêtes and
garden-parties, and have revels at Christmas, and amateur
theatricals, and knights and ladies gay, or devote
yourself to schools and almshouses, as a favorite hobby?
Come, a silver sixpence for your thoughts.”</p>

<p>Lois, standing perfectly still, leaning against the table,
with her hand resting on the carved back of her patroness’
chair, glanced at her ladyship, at the lawyer, and
at Captain Desfrayne. Then the soft, sweet eyes drooped.
She made no answer. It was impossible to tell from her
face what her feelings might be.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree was greatly disappointed by this cool
reception of the marvelous news, which had thrown herself
into a state of pleasurable excitement. She turned
to her nephew with eager curiosity.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me a few morsels of the contents of this
wonderful will?” she asked. “Who made the will?
Who has left all this money to my dear girl? What was
he? and why has he been so generous?”</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree had been quite fond of her companion;
but this sudden access of affection was due to the delightful
intelligence brought by the lawyer.</p>

<p>“The will would explain more clearly than I could do
all particulars,” Frank Amberley replied.</p>

<p>He felt it was absolutely impossible at that moment
to enter into any elucidation whatever, or even to give
an outline of the conditions of the will.</p>

<p>Lois extended the document toward Lady Quaintree.</p>

<p>“Is it very long?” her ladyship demanded, glancing at
Frank Amberley.</p>

<p>“It may take you five minutes to read it,” he answered.</p>

<p>She unfolded the paper, and ran her eye rapidly over
the contents. Not one of the others uttered a word—not
one ventured to look up, but remained as if carved out of
stone.</p>

<p>Lois found it well-nigh impossible to analyze her sensations;
but certainly the predominant one was that she
must be in a dream. She had every reason to be happy
with her protectress, who was as kind as if the near ties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
of relationship bound them together; but it would probably
be quite useless to search the world for the girl of
eighteen who could hear unmoved that she had suddenly
become the owner of a large fortune, especially if that
girl happened to be in a dependent position, and to move
constantly amid persons with whom money, rank, and
fashion were paramount objects of devotion.</p>

<p>She was the daughter of a court embroideress, who
had earned about four hundred a year by her labors and
those of her assistants; but Mrs. Turquand had never
been able—or thought she had not been—to lay by any
portion of her income as a provision for her child. Lady
Quaintree had always liked Lois as a child, and at the
death of her mother, three years since, had taken her to
be useful companion and agreeable company for herself.</p>

<p>That Lois had any expectations from any quarter whatever,
nobody ever for a moment supposed. Everybody of
Lady Quaintree’s acquaintance knew and liked the young
girl, who was so pretty, so obliging, so sweet-tempered.
That she should now be suddenly transformed into the
inheritress of great wealth was something like an incident
in a fairy-tale.</p>

<p>Mr. Amberley’s reflections were easily defined. He had
for months past loved this young girl, though he had
never yet had sufficient courage to declare as much, for
she seemed totally unconscious of his preference, and,
while certainly not distant nor icy with him, never gave
him the slightest reason to suppose that she ever as much
as remembered him when he was absent. He had, however,
the satisfaction of feeling sure that she cared for
no one else. Never even remotely had he hinted to Lady
Quaintree his secret, being well aware she would discountenance
his suit, for many reasons.</p>

<p>It was with the utmost bitterness of spirit that he had
seen the girl apparently removed from the possibility
of his being able to pay court to her; and at the same
time not only delivered into the sole charge of a probable
rival, but bound by the most stringent injunctions to
marry a young, handsome, and in every way attractive,
man—a man whom he judged, in his own distrustful humility,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
much more likely to seize the fancy of a young
beauty than he himself was.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne’s thoughts were utterly confused.
Since entering the room, he had scarcely spoken three
sentences, and he heartily wished himself anywhere rather
than in this softly illumined suite of rooms, facing this
beautiful girl with the angelic face, whom he had been
commanded and largely bribed to fall in love with and
make his wife.</p>

<p>He dreaded the moment when Lady Quaintree should
drop her gold-rimmed eye-glass, and the silence should be
broken. At the same time, the thought of his mother
never left him. What would she say when she learnt
the contents of this terrible will? Only too well he foresaw
the scenes he should be obliged to go through. As
for this girl herself, lovely as some poet’s vision, he resolved
to see as little of her as might be compatible with
the fulfilment of his legal duties and responsibilities toward
her. What a pitiful coward he felt himself! Why
could he not tell the truth, and save so much possible
future suffering?</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree read through the closely written document,
and then, folding it up, stared at each of the three
persons before her, with an almost comic expression of
amazement upon her fair, unwrinkled countenance.</p>

<p>“Captain Desfrayne,” she said, smiling as she held out
her hand, “I trust you will be pleased to remain with us
this evening as long as your inclinations or other engagements
permit. I expect some very pleasant friends—some
really distinguished persons, with whom you may either
already be well acquainted, or whom you might not object
to meet.”</p>

<p>There was such a stately yet gracious dignity in her
manner that Captain Desfrayne caught the infection, and
bowed over the delicate white hand with almost old-fashioned
chivalric courtesy.</p>

<p>“You will pardon my leaving you two gentlemen alone
for a few minutes,” she added. “Lois, my love, I will go
with you to your room.”</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree quitted the salon, followed by the
beautiful figure, clad in its cloudy robes of ethereal white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Let us go at once to your apartment, my child,” she
said, leading the way.</p>

<p>Her eyes were bright with eager excitement, for she
was surprised and pleased by the totally unexpected
change in her young companion’s fortunes; and she loved
the girl so much that she was rejoiced to see her rise from
her inferior station to one of wealth—to see so fair and
sunny a prospect opening before her.</p>

<p>She glided up the stairs with a step so alert that forty
years seemed lifted from her age; and in a minute they
were within the precincts of the pretty room which was
the domain of Lois Turquand.</p>

<p>“My love,” Lady Quaintree said, closing the door with
a careful hand, “I am so pleased I can hardly tell you
how much. You, no doubt, wish to know the contents of
this wondrous paper? My dear, it is as interesting as a
fairy-tale. You are a good girl, and deserve all the good
fortune Heaven may please to send you.”</p>

<p>She kissed the young girl’s forehead very kindly. Lois
returned the caress with passionate warmth, and laid her
head down upon her old friend’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Lois, before I give you this to read, I want you to
do something, which, perhaps, you might feel too agitated
afterward to manage.”</p>

<p>“What is that, dear madam?”</p>

<p>“You must not call me ‘madam’ or ‘my lady’ any more,
pet. I want you to change this fantastical dress for your
black silk, and wear my pretty jet ornaments, and also a
pair of my white gloves, with the black silk embroidery
which I bought in Paris. I think it is a mark of respect
you owe to your benefactor. Did you ever see or hear of
him?”</p>

<p>“Never, madam.”</p>

<p>“Shall I ring for Justine to help you in dressing?”</p>

<p>A faint smile dimpled the corners of the young girl’s
lips as she shook her head.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree looked about for the bell, then laughed
at her own forgetfulness. From this little chamber—formerly
a small dressing-room—there was no communication
with the servants’ domain. Her ladyship, taking the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
copy of the will with her, crossed to her own apartment,
only a few steps distant.</p>

<p>When she returned, she was followed by her waiting-maid,
who was carrying a package of black laces; a pair
of gloves; a filmy lace handkerchief, on which was some
black edging; and a black fan—one of Lady Quaintree’s
treasures, for it had once belonged to Marie Antoinette.</p>

<p>In those few minutes Lois had thrown off her cloudy
robes, divested herself completely of her assumed character
of Undine, and donned a handsome black silk evening-dress.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree was carrying a black-and-gold case,
which she placed upon the dressing-table and opened.
It contained a complete set of jet ornaments.</p>

<p>She ordered Justine to unfasten the black lace already
upon Miss Turquand’s robe, and replace it by that in her
custody.</p>

<p>The black lace selected by Lady Quaintree was, Justine
knew, very valuable, and the richest she had; the jet
ornaments, she also knew, her ladyship prized; so, great
was her secret amazement not only to see Miss Turquand
habited in black, when the blue and white she had
meant to wear was lying outspread upon a couch, but at
the lively interest displayed by Lady Quaintree in the
somber metamorphosis, and perhaps, above all, at the fact
of the stately dame being in Miss Turquand’s apartment.</p>

<p>The discreet Frenchwoman, however, said not one
word; but, taking out needles and thread from a “pocket-companion,”
she dexterously obeyed the orders received
from her mistress.</p>

<p>Lois was so astounded by the news she had heard that
she was incapable of doing anything but what, in fact,
she had already done, implicitly followed directions. She
permitted Lady Quaintree to clasp the jet suite upon her
neck and arms, and in her ears, and looked at the gloves,
and handkerchief, and fan with the glance of one walking
in her sleep.</p>

<p>Justine, wondering, though she did not utter a syllable,
was dismissed, and Lady Quaintree desired Lois to
sit down.</p>

<p>“We have already been absent nearly twenty minutes,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
she said, consulting her tiny watch. “I wished to arrange
your toilet before I told you what is really in this will.
Perhaps you think I treat you as a child; but you are
already agitated, and when you know the eccentric nature
of the conditions, you will, probably, be much startled.
Pray read it, my dear.”</p>

<p>Lois did so, with changing color and flashing eyes.
When she finished, she threw the paper upon the table,
and, rising from her chair, walked to and fro, as if under
the influence of uncontrollable emotion. Then she abruptly
paused before Lady Quaintree, extending her hands as
if in protest.</p>

<p>“Why should this person,” she exclaimed, “of whom
I never heard—of whom I knew nothing till this hour—why
should this stranger have left me all this money, and
why bind me with such conditions? I feel as if I could
not, ought not, to accept the gift he has given me. He
must have been a lunatic!”</p>

<p>“Softly, softly, softly, my dearest! You are talking
at random.”</p>

<p>“How can I face that man again?—he must know, of
course,” Lois continued vehemently, referring to Paul
Desfrayne.</p>

<p>“We shall see more clearly after a while, Lois. Certainly,
I am surprised by this affair; but perhaps my
nephew, Amberley, may be able to enlighten us a little
more. Come, let us go down. They will wonder if I, at
least, keep them waiting much longer.”</p>

<p>“No—no, dear Lady Quaintree. I cannot go now. I
feel as if I must shrink into the earth rather than meet
them again,” said Lois, recoiling as Lady Quaintree offered
her hand.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! I did not think my quiet, soft-spoken
Lois was made of such silly stuff.”</p>

<p>“Dear Lady Quaintree, I really <i>cannot</i> go now. Perhaps,
when the rooms are full of people, and I can hope
to escape observation, I may venture.”</p>

<p>“Will you faithfully promise to come when I send for
you—or, at least, in half an hour?”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, dear madam.”</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree was obliged to be satisfied. In her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
secret heart she was sorry for the conditions which so
horrified her young friend.</p>

<p>For a vast change had taken place in her plans since
she had heard her nephew tell his news. What she had
dreaded and feared hitherto she would now gladly see
accomplished; but here were difficulties, apparently insurmountable,
placed in her way.</p>

<p>As she paused for a moment on the threshold, she
glanced at the statuesque figure of Lois. A curious, superstitious
feeling crept over her, and a thrill of painful
presentiment passed through her heart.</p>

<p>The young girl had entered the room only some twenty
or thirty minutes before, arrayed like some glittering
creature of light, sparkling with diamonds, placed, by desire
of Lady Quaintree, among the gauzy folds of her
semitransparent robes to represent drops of water, her
superb, sun-bright hair floating like a halo of glory about
her, radiant as a spirit.</p>

<p>Now she was draped in somber black, her aspect
changed as by an enchanter’s wand. Her spiritual beauty
did not suffer, it is true. She looked, if possible, more
lovely thus shrouded; but—but still, Lady Quaintree
wished that the news had not involved donning signs
of mourning, and thought that people had no business
to dictate terms of love and marriage from the grave.</p>

<p>“An unlucky omen!” she thought, gathering up her
violet skirts and embroidered jupons.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A TRIPLE BONDAGE.</p>


<p>Lady Quaintree had hoped to glean a little more information
from the two gentlemen, for she was as much
excited as if she herself had been the inheritrix of the
eccentric old man’s money.</p>

<p>But she was disappointed. Scarcely had she returned
to the principal drawing-room, when five or six guests
arrived, and from that moment people came pouring into
the salons until there was a well-bred, well-dressed
throng.</p>

<p>Lois did not wait to be sent for. She came in with a
quiet, calm dignity of manner, the color a shade deeper
on her cheeks, and a feverish glitter in her eyes, but
otherwise self-possessed, as usual.</p>

<p>Her marked change of costume attracted universal
attention, and many inquiries were made. Lady Quaintree
had the supreme felicity of being able to diffuse the
information just received through a dozen different channels,
whereby she was sure it would permeate to society
in general.</p>

<p>“I should not have permitted her to appear had this
been a dancing-party,” she explained. “But it is so quiet,
and I am unable to manage without her.</p>

<p>“She is quite like a daughter to me,” she went on,
thoroughly believing her own enthusiastic speeches, and
feeling a maternal pride swell her bosom. A tear or so
lightly brushed away by her lace handkerchief would
have added to the effect, but tears come and go at will,
not at the command of those who would summon or dismiss
them.</p>

<p>Miss Turquand sat so tranquil in appearance, and bore
the masked battery of curious eyes so calmly, that some
people who listened with amazement were indignant.
Lady Quaintree’s companion did not seem conscious that
anything unusual had happened. Two or three times she
glanced through the veil of silken lashes which fringed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
her translucent gray eyes at Captain Desfrayne, but it
was a glance swift as lightning, not betraying the most
transient glimpse of the strange, mingled feelings of resentment
and lively interest aroused in her heart by the
claim made upon her in behalf of the handsome young
officer.</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne carefully avoided looking at his
beautiful charge. He seemed to be profoundly indifferent
on the subject of Mr. Vere Gardiner’s whims and fancies,
and neither approached Miss Turquand nor evinced the
slightest desire to become acquainted with her.</p>

<p>Frank Amberley and Lady Quaintree thought this
strange, but neither showed that they were in any way
conscious of Captain Desfrayne’s cold indifference toward
the young girl.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne found some people among the crowd
whom he knew, and was introduced to some others by
his hostess, or by Frank Amberley, so he ought not to
have experienced the profound sense of ennui and oppression
which made him long to be anywhere but in this brilliant
throng.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree at last seized an opportunity of questioning
her nephew on the subject of the mysterious old
man, and in a few words he gave her as much information
as he thought advisable.</p>

<p>“How extraordinary!” she said. “What a very romantic
case! I have no objection to his leaving a fine
fortune to my dear little girl, but I think he should not
have hampered her with such disagreeable conditions.
He seems to have been remarkably eccentric.”</p>

<p>“I knew scarcely anything of him,” Mr. Amberley replied.
“I think, certainly, it was an odd thing for him to
lay such an embargo on the liberty of two young people,
and I doubt not but the expression of his wishes will
most probably be the means of hindering them from——”</p>

<p>He abruptly paused. His aunt looked searchingly at
him, anxious to learn his secret thoughts, for more reasons
than one.</p>

<p>“I know Lois will never be the one to love when she
is ordered to dispose of her affections,” she said, very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
quietly. “And I am perfectly convinced she will never
marry any one whom she does not love.”</p>

<p>A most wonderfully indiscreet question—one which
he knew Lady Quaintree would not answer, but which
he longed to ask, nevertheless—trembled on the lips of the
young lawyer, yet he could not form the necessary words.
He was about to ask:</p>

<p>“Do you think she cares for any one at present?” But
Lady Quaintree was called away before he could muster
sufficient presence of mind even to debate with himself
whether it were possible to as much as hint such a query.</p>

<p>Lois’ opinion of Paul Desfrayne, gathered from those
fugitive glances, was that she could never like him even
as a friend. He seemed so cold, so self-absorbed, so
haughty, that her sense of antagonism deepened. The
strange, bewildering sense of magnetic attraction which
had fallen upon her during the first few moments of their
unexpected meeting had faded away, to be replaced by a
firmly rooted conviction that she could never entertain
even the mildest liking for this almost stern, melancholy
looking guardian.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne’s idea of Lois—at whom he had, indeed,
hardly glanced at all—was that, while beautiful as
a statue, she was as icy as if carved from marble.</p>

<p>Deeper and darker grew the cloud upon the young
man’s brow; and at length, finding a favorable chance to
escape unseen, he quitted the softly illumined drawing-room,
wherein he had deemed himself a prisoner; and
with a slow step he descended the wide, richly carpeted
staircase, revolving thoughts evidently not too pleasing.</p>

<p>He had just reached the bottom of the stairs when a
figure, radiant as Venus herself, alighted from a
brougham at the door, and swept over the threshold, in
all the pride and glory of the most brilliant and latest
Parisian toilet.</p>

<p>It was the woman who had been sitting in the balcony
in Porchester Square the previous evening, when the
weary pedestrian had stopped Captain Desfrayne, and
implored his pity.</p>

<p>Almost at the moment when she alighted, she was met
by a young man, who was about to enter the mansion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>This young man was Lady Quaintree’s only son—a
fair, slender, rather foppish young fellow, with a pale,
interesting face, and a pretty, graceful figure.</p>

<p>The attention of the resplendent creature in pink satin
and white lace was turned smilingly on this young man,
who stepped eagerly forward, and offered her his arm;
otherwise she must have seen Captain Desfrayne, who
gazed at her as people are supposed to stare at specters.</p>

<p>A few muttered, half-broken words escaped Paul Desfrayne’s
lips, and he looked hurriedly about, with the
air of an animal at bay. Then, swiftly turning, as the
two gay, laughing and flirting apparitions came up the
hall, he threw aside a crimson velvet portière, and plunged
recklessly into a room close at hand.</p>

<p>It was a moderate-sized sitting-room, flooded with a
soft, pure light, and deliciously cool in contrast to the
heated salons above.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne was about to congratulate himself on
the retired nook into which he had managed to tumble;
but almost at the instant when he entered, he heard a
silvery, musical voice, sounding so as to evidence that the
person who owned it was rapidly approaching from a conservatory
opening on the room—the voice of his mother,
speaking in animated conversation.</p>

<p>It was impossible to retreat, though he would gladly
have avoided even his idolized mother at that moment.
Nay, she was just then the last being he desired to see.</p>

<p>She would naturally be surprised to meet him here, for
until this evening he had scarcely known anything of
Lord or Lady Quaintree.</p>

<p>The clustered lights above the doorway, half-hidden
as they were by climbing exotics trained in prodigal profusion
about slender columns, shed their glowing beams
upon an animated face and superbly handsome figure, as
Mrs. Desfrayne appeared, arrayed, as was her wont, with
faultless taste. Her companion was Lord Quaintree, the
famous judge—a tall, noble old Englishman.</p>

<p>“I am free to confess, my lord,” she was saying, “that
I do not at all approve of the presence of these singing-women
at reunions such as this of to-night. They are
very well in their proper places, these people.” It would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
be impossible to give any idea of the insolent disdain
with which these words were uttered. “But they ought
not to be allowed to mix with——”</p>

<p>She suddenly paused, as she caught sight of Paul,
and, in her amazement, stood still, gazing upon him with
an expression of blank astonishment. Half-angry with
herself for being so surprised, she felt that she was accidentally
placed in an almost ludicrous position for the
moment; yet she could not as much as speak a word.</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne, for his part, could not have uttered
one syllable if his life had depended on it. He had
never, in all his days, felt so completely at a nonplus—so
forlorn, so distracted, as he did at this instant. A terrible
scene he knew was at hand, and he could not tell what
might be the result.</p>

<p>Lord Quaintree looked with surprise from one to the
other, not being able to comprehend what was passing
before his eyes. He had never seen Captain Desfrayne,
and could not guess why Mrs. Desfrayne should be thus
betrayed into so singular a display of emotion. Conscious
that probably he might be a little in the way, he
yet did not know how to move himself off the stage with
his ordinary easy grace.</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne was the first to speak. She exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Paul!”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne bowed.</p>

<p>“At your service, madam,” he said, very simply.</p>

<p>“I was not aware——Lord Quaintree, my son—my
only son—Captain Desfrayne.”</p>

<p>Lord Quaintree smiled, and held out his hand. He
saw that something was amiss, without knowing what.</p>

<p>“I hope to see you presently, Captain Desfrayne,” he
said, with his pleasant, urbane manner. “I must show
myself up-stairs at once, or my lady will think I have
run away.”</p>

<p>He left the room, surmising that the two would greatly
prefer being left together. But for very shame’s sake,
Paul would have caught him by the sleeve, and detained
him as a temporary shield.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">PAUL’S GALLING SHACKLES.</p>


<p>“You are surprised to see me here to-night, Mimi,”
Paul Desfrayne said, using an old childish pet-name that
always disarmed his mother. “I came here with a friend
to see Lady Quaintree”—he hesitated painfully—“on—on
business.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne opened her big blue eyes, and looked
him straight in the face. A spasm of pique passed
through her heart.</p>

<p>“You did not know that <i>I</i> was acquainted with Lady
Quaintree?” she remarked, half-sarcastically, opening
and shutting her fan with a movement which he knew
well of old as indicating vexation. She was angry that
he had come hither with some friend unknown to her,
instead of asking her for an introduction, and telling her
of his business.</p>

<p>“My dear mother, I did not know until this very afternoon
that I was to come here. I remembered, when I
heard the name, that you had spoken of her. It was she
who lent you the opera-box last night, was it not?”</p>

<p>“Well—well, it does not signify. I must not be inquisitive,”
said Mrs. Desfrayne, confident that she must
learn all sooner or later. “Have you heard or seen anything
of the young lady you spoke of yesterday evening?”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“You have?” cried Mrs. Desfrayne, drawing a step
or two nearer to him. “What is she like? Where does
she live? Is she pretty? What is she?”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne paused for an instant, as if perplexed
at such a volley of questions.</p>

<p>“Her name is Lois Turquand, and she is the companion
of Lady Quaintree,” he then very quietly replied.</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne retreated several steps, as if confounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“You are jesting!” she angrily exclaimed, unable to
credit that she had heard aright.</p>

<p>“I presume you have seen the young lady?”</p>

<p>“Miss Turquand!” Mrs. Desfrayne slowly repeated—“Lois
Turquand! Oh, it is impossible!”</p>

<p>The information did not seem to afford her much
pleasure, and there was a visible expression of blank disappointment
upon her face.</p>

<p>The truth—or part of the truth—was that Mrs. Desfrayne
had no great liking for Lois Turquand. By nature
aristocratic, proud as a duchess of Norman descent, she
cared not for persons beneath her in station, while winning
and all that was gracious to those in her own rank
or above her.</p>

<p>To Lady Quaintree, wife of the world-famed lawyer,
she had ever paid eager court; but Miss Turquand, the
daughter of an embroideress, a penniless nobody, she had
always politely ignored. When her son had told her of
the strange will which had placed him in such an unexpectedly
advantageous position, she had built, with feminine
imaginative rapidity and skill, sparkling castles in
the traitorous air. All her life she had yearned to mix
freely in society—she longed to be a leader of fashion,
a star in the hemisphere of the beau monde; but her income
was limited. Her husband, a colonel in the army,
had died almost a poor man, leaving her some six hundred
a year, and to her son an equal pittance—for such
she considered it, measured by her desires and wants.
She was still young and most beautiful when left a widow,
and might have married again advantageously, but
her overweening ambition had induced her to reject more
than one excellent offer, and now it was too late to retrieve
these errors of judgment—though she still had her
secret plans and schemes.</p>

<p>Under a fair and smiling mask she hid many little
feminine piques and spites, and one of her pet “aversions”
happened to be Miss Turquand. She could hardly
pardon the girl her roseate youth, her fresh, piquant loveliness,
her grace, spontaneous as that of a wood-nymph.
For some reason, unexplainable even to herself, she always
experienced a horribly galling sense of being old,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
and world-worn, and artificial, in presence of Lois Turquand,
and it created a small vindictive sense of envy and
spite that augured ill for any future attempt at conciliation.
Her short-lived dream of taking the young person
left in her son’s charge in hand, and shining in society
by means of a reflected light, was at an end.</p>

<p>She could have better endured to hear that the legatee
was a plain young woman, in a vastly inferior station. It
was as if her son had held a draft of gall and wormwood
to her lips, and asked her to swallow it.</p>

<p>“It is incredible!” she said, after a brief pause, during
which she kept her eyes fixed upon her son’s face.</p>

<p>“You have certainly surprised me,” she added, slightly
shrugging her shoulders. “Though why I should feel
surprise, I cannot tell. It is absurd, I have no doubt. So
Miss Turquand has become a young woman of property.
I long ago was determined not to be astonished at anything,
and I take a fresh resolution from to-night. Was
the person who left her this money a relative?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Not a relative! May I ask what——Am I indiscreet
in asking for any particulars?”</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne knew that sooner or later his mother
must become acquainted with everything that the will
contained. It was better to take things with a good
grace, and let her hear now, than to shrink and keep silence,
or grant half-confidences, and make bad worse, by
appearing to make a mystery of what was apparently a
simple matter.</p>

<p>“The old gentleman of whom I was speaking to you
last night—Mr. Vere Gardiner—has left Miss Turquand
one hundred and thirty thousand pounds unconditionally.
He has left me ten thousand in the same way, but——”</p>

<p>With an effort he rapidly told her the general contents
of the will.</p>

<p>“You marry Miss Turquand!” almost angrily cried
Mrs. Desfrayne, flirting her fan backward and forward
with a nervous movement. She had seated herself, in
her agitation, while Paul remained standing a few steps
from her.</p>

<p>“Such are the terms of the will. If she dies before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
three years have expired, I am to receive—I forget how
many thousands.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen her?”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“How do you like her?”</p>

<p>“Not at all, as far as I can judge.”</p>

<p>A smile, almost of gratification, rippled over the fair,
smooth face of his mother at this admission. She was
on the point of exclaiming: “I am glad of it!” but
checked herself, and remarked instead:</p>

<p>“How is it that I find you here alone?”</p>

<p>These words recalled Captain Desfrayne to his exact
position. He felt as if he could have given worlds to
speak with the old freedom to the woman who loved him
so fondly—could he but explain to her what weighed
upon his life like a constant nightmare. But it was impossible.
He was a coward, and dared not face her inevitable
anger.</p>

<p>“I was going away just as I saw you,” he replied, with
apparent tranquillity, though his heart for a moment had
beat wildly at the thought of making his confession.
“The rooms were frightfully hot up-stairs, and this place
seemed so cool and inviting, I lingered.”</p>

<p>“You will take me up-stairs, however. Does Lady
Quaintree know you are my son?”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne had not thought of it.</p>

<p>“I have such an intolerable headache!” he pleaded,
anxious to escape; and his temples throbbed to agony.
“I really cannot stay.”</p>

<p>“That is very unusual with you, having a headache,”
said his mother. “What is the cause of it?”</p>

<p>The young man shrugged his shoulders without replying
in words.</p>

<p>His mother urged him, only half-believing in his excuse,
to escort her up-stairs. She had many reasons for
desiring his company. Although it was a little vexatious,
perhaps, for so young-looking a woman to be attended
by a son who seemed nearly as old as she did herself,
she always wished for his escort. He was so handsome,
so dignified, so chivalrous, gallant, devoted, in his behavior—there
was the mother’s pride and glory to atone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
in a measure for the beauty’s mortified vanity. At this
moment she wished to see him with Miss Turquand, to
judge how far affairs were likely to go; she wanted to
hear Lady Quaintree’s opinion, and see how Miss Turquand
carried herself beneath the golden blaze of her
new prosperity. But it was in vain she urged him, and
she was piqued by this odd refusal. He was determined
to go at once.</p>

<p>“Well, you must call to-morrow, Paul. I am dying
with curiosity to hear all the rest, and your opinion, and
so on.”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne escaped. The balmy air cooled his
fevered pulses, and he walked rapidly away into the darkness
of the summer’s night.</p>

<p>“Good heavens, what an escape!” he muttered. “I
don’t know what earthly inducement could have impelled
me to go up-stairs. My poor mother! What an ungrateful
villain I feel in deceiving her! It was an accursed
day when that brilliant butterfly crossed my path, and led
me away as easily as ever schoolboy was lured into a
mad chase on an idle afternoon, or peasant lout drawn
into pursuit of a gleaming Jack-o’-lantern. There is no
peace, no happiness for me henceforth. I sometimes wish
my mother knew all. It would be an infinite weight lifted
off my mind; and yet I dare not—I dare not tell her.”</p>

<p>The desire to be rid of this painful secret rose so
strongly within his breast, that when he had traversed
several streets, he abruptly paused to reflect on the advisability
of going to the house in Porchester Square,
where his mother was staying, and awaiting her return,
with the object of telling her precisely how he was situated.</p>

<p>“No,” he at length decided. “I <i>cannot</i> do so to-night.
To-morrow, perhaps, I shall be more courageous. If this
unlucky piece of ‘good fortune,’ as I suppose some folks
would style it, had not occurred, I might have borne my
secret some few years longer—maybe forever—safe
locked within my breast, there to gnaw away my life at its
ease. But this misguided old man’s absurd whim has
been the fatal means of letting in a flood of misery now
and in the future upon my most unhappy head. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
well that the girl is cold and seemingly impassive. It
is also providential that she has powerful friends, who
will render my duties merely nominal.”</p>

<p>The sleepy quiet of the aristocratic street through
which he was passing with slow, undecided steps was
broken by swift-rolling wheels.</p>

<p>The gleaming lamps of a dashing brougham threw long
gleams of light through the semiobscurity of the somber
thoroughfare, and the champ of the horses’ feet, the jingle
of the silver harness, evidenced that the vehicle belonged
to some one of wealth, if not of position.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne’s glance was mechanically attracted to
this handsome equipage, unconsciously to himself.</p>

<p>As it passed him, the face of a woman appeared at the
window—the face of Madam Guiscardini thus coming
before him like an apparition for the second time this
night.</p>

<p>Her face looked like some beautiful pictured head
painted on a dark background. She did not see him, but
spoke to the coachman, apparently giving him some new
direction. Glancing forth like a vision, she as rapidly
vanished again, and in a moment the brougham had
swept off down one of the side streets.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne struck his hands together with a gesture
of despair.</p>

<p>“She seems to haunt me to-night like some evil spirit,”
he muttered. “I did not know she was in London. Her
face fills me with affright and a sense of coming danger.
Can it be true that I once fancied I loved this woman,
and that I let her crush my life forevermore with
her cold, pitiless hand? Can it be that I am her bond-slave—no
longer free to do more than move in the one
dull round day by day, with these galling shackles about
me, forced to relinquish all the bright hopes of love and
happiness that bring sunshine about other men? Oh!
fool, fool, fool that I have been!” he cried, aloud.</p>

<p>Then he once more quickened his steps, as if to escape
from himself.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">AN UNINTENTIONAL CUT.</p>


<p>Mrs. Desfrayne then went up-stairs unattended—an
arrangement not at all to her liking, for she would fain
still retain all the airs and customs of a beauty yet in the
heyday of sunshiny existence.</p>

<p>She swept one searching glance round the suite of
crowded rooms, seeking the unwelcome figure of Lois
Turquand.</p>

<p>It was the work of some minutes discovering Lois.
The young girl stood a little apart from the throng, her
graceful head slightly bent as she listened to the earnest
words of a stately dowager, who was probably congratulating
her upon her change of fortune.</p>

<p>There was a dignity and a certain consciousness in
Lois’ bearing which Mrs. Desfrayne had never noticed
with her before. She reproached herself now for having
been so uniformly cold and frigid with the girl, for she
adored wealth, and she judged by herself that it was
impossible the new-made heiress could overlook or forgive
all the petty slights she had suffered from the insolent
widow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne was going to address Lady Quaintree,
when Miss Turquand crossed quickly, not perceiving her.
She laid a detaining hand on the young girl’s arm.</p>

<p>“I am delighted to hear of your good fortune, my
dear,” she said, with a little perceptible embarrassment.</p>

<p>Lois raised her clear eyes, and looked for a moment
into the suavely smiling face before her with an expression
difficult to define. Then she bowed: it was a perfectly
gracious but decidedly icy inclination. She did not
answer in words; but, with an ambiguous smile, passed
on.</p>

<p>Never for an instant could Mrs. Desfrayne have imagined
in her wildest fancies that the tables could have
been so completely turned upon her.</p>

<p>It was a fine moral lesson, only, unfortunately, it fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
short of its mark; and the coldness of Miss Turquand,
partly unintentional and partly arising from habit, made
the haughty woman of the world detest yet more the girl
whom she had hitherto simply ignored and noticed as little
as if she had been a piece of furniture of very ordinary
importance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne turned pale with rage. She almost
wished the old man who had made the eccentric will had
been sunk to the bottom of the sea ere he had committed
his money and his ridiculous desires to paper. <i>That girl</i>
the wife of her son! Truly, she had need be radiant
with the glitter of gold before she could possess any attractions
in the eyes of this proud and ambitious, yet
narrow-minded, woman.</p>

<p>Many mothers are quite willing to think with some
complacence of an ideal wife for their sons—a wife to
be selected by themselves, perhaps: a creature of the
imagination. But when it comes to be a matter of sober
reality—when there is a real flesh-and-blood being, not
a stone ideal, set before them—why, it is a very different
affair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne made her way to Lady Quaintree, and
promised herself that she would arrange for a long chat
on this absorbing subject, if she could persuade her good
hostess to ask for her company in a drive round the park.</p>

<p>During the singing of some Italian duets by the artists
who had been gathered together for the night, she contrived
to learn a good deal.</p>

<p>One thing she accidentally ascertained which a little
modified her vague schemes and speculations.</p>

<p>She discovered that hitherto Lady Quaintree had been
in terror lest her son Gerald should fall in love with Miss
Turquand. Now this would be the most desirable thing
that could happen, even if the young girl were shorn of
half her newly acquired fortune.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree did not know she was betraying her
secret wishes, but Mrs. Desfrayne was very quick-witted,
and at the same time a pattern of tranquil discretion.</p>

<p>Frank Amberley did not leave the charmed precincts
of the house until he could not stay any longer. The
more the object of his passionate attachment was withdrawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
from his reach, the more mad did his longing become
to possess her. But he was an honorable man, and
all should be fair in the fight.</p>

<p>He had closely watched Paul Desfrayne until that
young man’s departure, and the feeling of deep mistrust
against him had painfully intensified. It was with a profound
sense of relief, however, that he found neither
Captain Desfrayne nor Lois apparently disposed to cultivate
any approach to acquaintanceship.</p>

<p>For some time before the hour fixed for supper, he had
hovered about Lois, with the hope of being able to offer
her his arm down-stairs. The sharp eyes of Lady Quaintree
were on the alert, unfortunately for the success of his
plans, and to his anger and mortification he saw Lois
assigned to a stranger.</p>

<p>As he flung himself wearily into a hansom, and lighted
his cigar for consolation during his journey homeward,
Frank Amberley had ample subject-matter for meditation.</p>

<p>Although not so bitter or remorseful, his thoughts
were scarcely more agreeable than those of Paul Desfrayne.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THE NEW VALET.</p>


<p>Captain Desfrayne walked with hasty, irregular steps
in the direction of his own home.</p>

<p>The servant who admitted him said that a person was
waiting up-stairs, being earnestly desirous of an interview.</p>

<p>“I should not have let him wait, sir,” the man added
apologetically, “only he said he had an appointment with
you for to-day, and seemed so dreadfully disappointed
because he didn’t see you.”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne had altogether forgotten that he
had desired the Italian valet to call upon him. His conscience
reproached him for what he considered selfishness,
in being so engrossed; and he hurried up to his own
apartments.</p>

<p>The doors of the inner rooms were locked; but there
was a pleasant little antechamber, almost luxuriously
furnished as a smoking-room.</p>

<p>This was now fully lighted from a handsome chandelier;
and standing at the table in the center of the apartment
was the tall, gaunt Italian who had claimed Captain
Desfrayne’s sympathy the evening before.</p>

<p>The evening before! It seemed to Paul Desfrayne
as if it must have been months since he had gone through
that short, half-smiling interview with his mother.</p>

<p>The table was scattered over with newspapers, magazines,
French novels, and other aids to kill time agreeably
and intellectually at the same time.</p>

<p>As Captain Desfrayne entered, the Italian servant was
looking at one of the papers intently—so much absorbed
that his left hand unconsciously crushed it.</p>

<p>It was that day’s issue of an illustrated paper.</p>

<p>The entire page upon which the eyes of the man
seemed fixed was occupied by an oval-shaped portrait of
a lady—of whom, Captain Desfrayne could not discern.</p>

<p>The fellow clenched his right hand, and shook it at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
the mute representation of the beautiful woman, and
muttered some words in Italian, in so low a key that their
import did not reach Captain Desfrayne.</p>

<p>The next moment the step of the latter made the valet
start violently and turn. He fumbled with the paper,
and tried to turn over the pages, but his hands were
trembling so much that he was unable to do so; and
Captain Desfrayne was at the table before he could conceal
what had so much interested him.</p>

<p>It was the engraved portrait of the beautiful singer
who had been sitting in the balcony in Porchester Square
the evening before.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne looked at the man, who had not had
time to compose his features. There was an expression
of deadly hatred yet lingering upon them, though he evidently
tried hard to master his emotion.</p>

<p>For an instant Captain Desfrayne felt an almost overwhelming
desire to speak to him about the signora; but
a second thought determined him to be silent, and appear
not to have noticed the little mute scene. He resolved,
however, at all hazards, to engage this man in his service;
for his curiosity, if no deeper feeling, was strongly
excited.</p>

<p>“My good fellow,” he began, in a very kindly tone, “I
am sincerely sorry, but I totally forgot our arrangement.
I had business of the utmost importance to attend to, and
so it slipped from my memory.”</p>

<p>Gilardoni bowed very low, dexterously turning the paper
as he did so.</p>

<p>“I trust you will excuse the liberty I took in waiting
for you, sir,” he answered, with profound humility. “But
I have no friend save you, if I can dare to call you a
friend.”</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne had resolved to take the fellow into
his service, if he were anything short of an escaped galley-slave.
He did not tell him so, however, but said very
quietly:</p>

<p>“I hope I may be able to show you some kindness, for
you seem sorely in need of it.”</p>

<p>Gilardoni clasped his hands, and looked at the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“I will serve you truly and well, if you will let me,”
he cried.</p>

<p>“What recommendations—what credentials have you
to show?” asked Captain Desfrayne.</p>

<p>The man eagerly unbuttoned his shabby, threadbare
coat, and, diving his thin fingers into an inner pocket,
drew forth a bundle of letters and papers. He chose one
document, which he extended to Captain Desfrayne.</p>

<p>“This is a written character from my poor master, sir.
You knew his writing—you will see what he says of me.”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne took the envelope; and opening it,
was about to extract the enclosure, when a small, folded
morsel of note-paper fell out, and dropped on the table.
Quick as lightning, Gilardoni snatched it up—not rudely,
but with a kind of panic expressed in his face and in every
gesture.</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne’s eye had caught sight of the characters
before he was aware that he was guilty of any possible
indiscretion in looking upon them.</p>

<p>The blood rushed to his face, and then receded to his
heart. Only too easily did he recognize the ill-formed
characters. It was the writing of the woman who had
influenced his life for evil—the beautiful Signora Guiscardini.</p>

<p>With infinite presence of mind, he affected not to have
particularly observed the stray, fluttering paper, and began
to read the letter of recommendation.</p>

<p>More than ever, he had made up his mind to receive
this man into his service. He longed to ask him, then
and there, bluntly, what the mysterious tie might be
that caused him to take so much interest in the signora,
and why he had a note written by her in his possession—a
note which he evidently feared any one else might see.</p>

<p>He was unable to study the man’s face; for as he read
the recommendatory letter, he was conscious that the
fellow’s keen eyes were fixed upon him with a furtive
anxiety.</p>

<p>“When can you come to me?” he asked.</p>

<p>A glitter as of tears of delight gleamed in those
bright, half-hungry eyes, as Gilardoni eagerly answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“Any time. To-night, if you will, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well. So be it.”</p>

<p>The little details of terms and so on were soon settled.
Captain Desfrayne unlocked the door leading to
the inner apartments, and in a very few minutes Gilardoni
was occupied in noiselessly flitting about, putting
things straight with an almost womanly softness and dexterity.
Captain Desfrayne threw himself upon a sofa,
lighted a cigar, and, leaning back, watched him with a
curiosity that was attaining an uncomfortable height.</p>

<p>“I would give a thousand pounds, if I were so rich,
to know what link there is between this poor wretch and
the star singer,” he thought. “But I am sure to know
in time, I imagine, and I must not startle him.</p>

<p>“Give me some of those papers that are lying on the
table in the next room,” he said, aloud.</p>

<p>Gilardoni obeyed his orders with nimble alacrity, and
lighted a reading-lamp that stood on a table at the head
of the couch.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">PLAYING AT CROSS-PURPOSES.</p>


<p>Captain Desfrayne selected a paper, and slowly turned
over the pages as he cut them. Some time elapsed before
he spoke; for he could not exactly frame words in which
to put the question he meant to ask.</p>

<p>“What part of Italy did you come from?” he inquired
carelessly, following the spiral line of cigar-smoke, as he
breathed it from his lips.</p>

<p>Gilardoni looked at him with that furtive glance Captain
Desfrayne had already noticed; but replied, without
seeming to hesitate:</p>

<p>“From Florence, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Have you any relatives living?”</p>

<p>“None, sir. Not one. My father and mother died
when I was a young child, leaving me to the care of a
distant relative, who has since died, and I never had
either brothers or sisters.”</p>

<p>The faint suspicion that had arisen in Paul Desfrayne’s
mind that the brilliant prima donna might be
this fellow’s sister, was then negatived. Probably, some
humble lover of her early days, whom she had despised,
perhaps jilted? So superbly beautiful a creature, born in
an Italian village, must have had many adorers; and he
knew her to be arrogant and callous of other people’s
feelings, and incredibly vain of her own manifold attractions.</p>

<p>“A countrywoman of yours,” he abruptly said, with an
effort at smiling, as he turned out the large, oval engraving
of Madam Guiscardini.</p>

<p>Gilardoni could not refuse to look; but he drew back
his lips as some animals do when in a fury. The action
might pass for an affirmative smile, but it was uglier than
any frown.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he curtly replied.</p>

<p>“Did you know her?”</p>

<p>Gilardoni did not respond this time; but gave his attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
to a tall vase, which he seemed to find in need
of being relieved of the dust that had accumulated round
the flutings.</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne waited for a minute, and then repeated
the question.</p>

<p>“Why, sir, everybody knows her—everybody all over
the world,” Gilardoni answered, only half-turning round.</p>

<p>He spoke with a strong effort to display indifference;
but his manner and voice both betrayed singular constraint.
Paul Desfrayne was prepared for this, and did
not take any notice, but continued:</p>

<p>“She was but a village girl, I suppose, when you knew
her? They say she is going to marry a Russian prince.”</p>

<p>This time Gilardoni made a great effort, and, looking
his new master full in the face, with a vacant, uninterested
expression, said:</p>

<p>“Do they, sir?”</p>

<p>There was no doubt that Gilardoni was on his guard,
and would not betray more than he could possibly help.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne would not give up yet, for that eager
desire to know what secret reason this man had for hating
Madam Guiscardini so bitterly as he seemed to do
was almost unconquerable.</p>

<p>“They say,” he went on slowly, lowering his eyes, and
taking a tiny nail-knife from his waistcoat-pocket, to keep
his glances ostentatiously employed, “that the beautiful
songstress is already married.”</p>

<p>These men were playing at cross-purposes. The master
would have given all he possessed in the world to
have learned the secret which was of no value whatever
to the servant. Four monosyllables would have served to
unlock those dreary prison doors, and let in the light
of possible happiness upon that poor, weary soul, who
was suffering the penalty of the one mistake of his young
life.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne glanced for a swift instant at Gilardoni.
The Italian’s strong, nervous hands were clutched
fast upon the top of the chair in front of him; his face
was alternately red and pale, and his eyes were gleaming
like fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“Who told you that?” he demanded, in a sepulchral
whisper.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Captain Desfrayne answered, slightly
shrugging his shoulders. “People tell you all sorts of
things about eminent singers and public characters generally.”</p>

<p>Gilardoni leaned his long, thin body forward, and
stared his master in the face.</p>

<p>“Then where do they say her husband is?” he demanded,
in the same sibilant whisper.</p>

<p>The mystery seemed clearer now. He was an old lover—perhaps
once a favorite—of madam’s. It was hardly
worth the trouble of talking to the fellow; and Paul Desfrayne
felt half-enraged with himself for having done
so. But now that he wished the conversation ended, or,
rather, that he had not begun it, Gilardoni seemed determined
to continue it.</p>

<p>“Idle gossip all, I doubt not,” Captain Desfrayne said
carelessly. “You, who come from her native village,
would be more likely than anybody else to guess who the
lucky individual might happen to be, and where he might
be found; for if she had married any one after she quitted
her village, it would have been somebody of importance.”</p>

<p>“Somebody to talk about—somebody to be proud of,”
Gilardoni cried, his eyes flashing with a strange light.
“If she had married a poor man——”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly; Captain Desfrayne laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “If she had married a poor man, she
would have hated and despised him. Perhaps she did
marry a poor man, and is not able to marry the Russian
prince,” he added, knocking the ash carelessly from his
cigar.</p>

<p>“She would have hated and despised him,” Gilardoni
repeated slowly, with intense acrimony in his accent. “Do
<i>you</i> know whether she is married or not?” he abruptly
demanded, the keen, furtive, eager, inquiring look in his
eyes again.</p>

<p>“Come, I think we have talked enough about Madam
Guiscardini,” answered Captain Desfrayne, in almost a
harsh tone, rising from his couch. “I don’t see that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
there can be any particular interest for you or for me in
the subject.”</p>

<p>He felt quite sure now that this was some early lover,
who so madly adored the brilliant operatic star that he
could not bear the thought that she should belong to another,
although she never could be his. He felt disappointed
and vexed with himself for permitting his eager
curiosity to carry him so far from his customary reserve
and dignity as to lead him into gossiping with his servant,
a fellow whom until yesterday he scarcely knew existed.</p>

<p>In a softer tone he dismissed his new attendant, telling
him some of the people about the house would show him
the room where he was to sleep. Gilardoni quitted the
room with a profound inclination, and Captain Desfrayne,
almost to his relief, was left alone.</p>

<p>“The affair is very simple,” he muttered to himself, as
he walked to the window and threw it open to breathe the
delicious air of the fair June night—“very simple. These
Italians are so susceptible, and so revengeful. Probably
<i>la</i> Lucia flirted with him in her early days, before the
dawn of splendor and riches came upon her and led her
to think——Pooh! the story is commonplace to nausea—insipid.
I don’t care to know anything about her more
than I already know. What good would it do me?”</p>

<p>He rested his head against the framework of the window,
and gazed abstractedly into the deserted street. The
moon had risen in full majesty, and was flooding every
place with silver light. A party of young men came
along the pavement arm in arm, singing, as the students
in “Faust” came along that memorable night.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne listened. The music was familiar to
him; the words he knew well, and could distinguish
them.</p>

<p>The first time Paul Desfrayne had heard Lucia Guiscardini
sing upon the stage, she had sung those verses.
They haunted him yet. They now brought back memories
steeped in pain and bitterness.</p>

<p>Wearied in body, sick at heart, he closed the window
to shut out those distasteful strains, and went with slow
steps to his bedroom.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">BUILDING ON SAND.</p>


<p>Mrs. Desfrayne felt much as Alnaschar is described to
have felt when he found his radiant visions at an end.
She had built up a perfect Aladdin’s Palace of bright and
fairy enjoyment, and now it had faded completely.</p>

<p>She was endowed with a lively imagination, and had
rapidly conjured up dreams as charming as they were
baseless, like a boarding-school girl building up a delicious
<i>château d’Espagne</i> with enameled bits of painted
cardboard.</p>

<p>She had never liked the quiet, graceful girl who was
such a favorite with Lady Quaintree, and now she was in
a fair way to hate her. What, perhaps, angered her more
than anything else was that this girl should, of all others,
have been selected by some one totally unknown to her
to be her son’s wife.</p>

<p>She had no desire that Paul should marry, though
she had a vague idea that she would be glad if he discovered
some wealthy and beautiful heiress, and was successful
in his suit. Jealous of any creature who might threaten
to divide with her the affections of her beloved child,
the thought that Lois Turquand should be her rival was
gall and wormwood. But she was keenly disappointed
in her airy hopes and expectations, raised on a foundation
of sand as they had been, with no knowledge whatever
of the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>Like some foolish women, and also some silly men,
she had a most objectionable habit of judging and trying
cases by the aid of imagination alone, unassisted by common
sense, and she was now suffering under a result
which a cooler head might have anticipated as just possible.</p>

<p>The more she thought about the matter, the more angry
and disappointed she became. Indeed, she reasoned
herself into the notion that she had been badly used somehow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
by somebody in some way, and resented her injuries
accordingly.</p>

<p>Miss Turquand had possessed one friend more in the
world than she deemed herself entitled to count. She
had now one enemy more since her sudden rise to fortune.</p>

<p>Of Mrs. Desfrayne Miss Turquand was certainly not
thinking at this exciting period.</p>

<p>The young girl could scarcely realize the change in her
destiny. It was like a tale in the “Arabian Nights.”
Hitherto her life had been almost uneventful, and decidedly
not unhappy. She had little occasion to look forward
to the future which lay before her, gray and shadowed,
but not dark. Her mistress, or patroness, was kind
and fond of her—honestly and truly fond, and she felt
toward her as an affectionate daughter might to an indulgent
mother. Of a cheerful and contented disposition,
she had been well satisfied with her comfortable home and
genial surroundings.</p>

<p>Love had not touched her, though probably she had
cherished her roseate fancies and preferences, like all
other girls in their teens. Unlike many of her sisterhood,
however, she was gifted with a singularly clear insight
into character, and she was easily disenchanted.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree had met with her by accident, as it
seemed. Mrs. Turquand, left a widow at an early age,
had turned her genius for exquisite embroidery to account,
and was able to acquire a large circle of patrons.
She was gentle, obliging, prompt; she engaged assistants,
and had made an income of about four hundred a year;
but was unable to provide for her only child, having to
meet expenses large in proportion to her earnings. By
many little acts, she had pleased Lady Quaintree; and
at her death, Lois being about fourteen, her ladyship had
taken the child, who had not a relative in the world that
she knew of, and from that time the two had scarcely
parted for a day, Lois being carefully trained at home
by excellent instructors.</p>

<p>It was a trying test just now for the girl, passing
through a fiery furnace. For a girl of eighteen, beautiful,
and not quite unconscious of her beauty—for, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
the nature of her position, she had been exposed to the
open fire of admiration and gallantry hardly known to
girls of a higher rank, surrounded by as sure a fence of
protection as any Chinese or Turkish princess—it was
a terrible ordeal.</p>

<p>The oddly devised will left Lady Quaintree in a flutter
of pleasant “bother,” for she took her protégée’s affairs
in hand, and was determined to nestle the girl under her
motherly old wings more closely than ever. The dead
man’s whims interfered with a delightful little plan which
had spread into being within her constantly active brain,
as surely as they had marred Mrs. Desfrayne’s schemes.</p>

<p>Her daughters were all married, and it was partly a
feeling of loneliness on their quitting the paternal roof
that had induced her to take Lois as her companion.</p>

<p>She had one son. Mrs. Desfrayne did not adore her
boy more devoutly than Lady Quaintree worshiped the
Honorable Gerald Danvers. In her eyes he was the perfection
of every manly grace. He was good-looking
enough, and he regarded himself as an absolute Adonis.
He was good-natured when his whims and fancies were
not interfered with, and his great aim was to go through
life with as little trouble as possible.</p>

<p>Lord Quaintree left the management of his son completely
in the hands of the mother. The Honorable Gerald
had bitterly disappointed his hopes and wounded his
pride. He had built up a delightful little castle in the
air during the boyhood of this only son, which had been
blown to the winds when the Honorable Gerald entered
his teens.</p>

<p>He saw that nothing could be made of Gerald, and
therefore agreed, without a murmur, to the proposal of
the mother that the youth should become a soldier. However,
he resented the denseness of this handsome, empty
pate as deeply as if it had been the poor boy’s fault instead
of his misfortune.</p>

<p>The old man was not only a great lawyer and an intellectual
giant, but tender-hearted and religious, and took
an interest in ragged-schools, refuges, and various kindred
institutions for the benefit of tangled bundles of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
patchwork clothing. If it had been possible, he would
have put his boy into the church; but Gerald was fit for
nothing.</p>

<p>The Honorable Gerald imagined himself of a romantic
turn of mind, and he found Lois Turquand the prettiest
and decidedly the most interesting girl he had ever seen.
So he took the idea into his head that he was in love with
her, and accordingly flirted in a languid manner with her,
or tried to do so. He did not pretend to have any “intentions,”
and his mother was certain there was not any
particular danger.</p>

<p>Lois treated his advances with supreme indifference.
He liked to see her open her great, serious eyes at some
of his silly compliments, half in astonishment, half in rebuke;
he liked to flatter himself with the notion that those
large, brilliant, liquid eyes would soften into ineffable
sweetness if he condescended to throw himself at her
feet. He was indeed as far in love with her as he could
be with anybody but himself.</p>

<p>That he should ever be so rash, so insane, as to marry
her companion, Lady Quaintree had not feared. Had he
been a different kind of young man, she might have
dreaded the occasional intimate meeting between these
two. But there was no reason to be alarmed, and she
sunned herself in the bright, cheerful sweetness of the
young girl’s company without the slightest misgiving.
Had she been obliged to choose any one from love for her
son’s wife, she would have gathered this charming flower
from the garden of girls. And now many would try to
win Lois. Not by birth, but by wealth, she was on a level
with the sparkling beauties about her, from whom she had
hitherto been fenced off.</p>

<p>Lois had another lover, though scarcely an acknowledged
one: Frank Amberley, Lady Quaintree’s nephew.
The affection which had crept into his heart day by day
was strong as a current flowing down from a mountain.
From the day that Lois had entered the house of Lady
Quaintree—literally from that day, for he happened to
be there the very afternoon that the young child of fourteen
had come hither—he had watched her grow up, like
some fair and beautiful plant. For four years he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
deeply loved this girl as he could never, never love again,
he knew.</p>

<p>From the time he had discovered the state of his own
feelings, he had steadily sought to win her regard: that
he had gained, but not the love he prayed for. She liked
and trusted him as a friend—nothing more—not one
atom more, he was well aware. His love shone upon her
as the sun shines upon glass or water—reflected back, it
is true, but with perfect coldness.</p>

<p>Lois vaguely surmised that he loved her, but he had
never told her so.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree ardently desired now to see Lois the
wife of her beloved son. But how about the one whom
the dead old man had decreed to be the husband of this
beautiful girl? The difficulties in the way loomed large.
He certainly had not appeared very anxious the night before
to take any advantage of his position, or to seek to
improve his acquaintance with the girl thus placed under
his charge.</p>

<p>Great was the amazement of the Honorable Gerald
when he heard of the good fortune that had befallen Lois.</p>

<p>“By Jove! what a crotchety old dolt!” was his exclamation.
“Why couldn’t he leave the girl untrammeled?”</p>

<p>But he said it to himself, for Lois was standing by.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree asked her what she was going to do.</p>

<p>“To remain exactly as I am, dearest madam.”</p>

<p>“Absurd! Impossible, my love!”</p>

<p>“If you wish me to be happy,” Lois pleaded, “you will
let me go on as I have done for these four peaceful years.
I wish for no change.”</p>

<p>Her ladyship glanced keenly from her son to Lois and
back again, but without perceiving the slightest sign that
the desire expressed by Lois might be dictated by some
deeper feeling than affection for herself.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, be it as you will. Let us make no
change for the present, if it so please you. All I bargain
for is that we do a little delightful shopping for your
benefit, darling. You must shine with the bravest. Frank
asked if we could go to his office to see the original will;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
but my lord has undertaken to see that everything is right,
and to save us all trouble.”</p>

<p>Again she glanced at Lois’ face as she pronounced the
name of her nephew; but not a ray of conscious pleasure,
not a blush, betrayed a spark of interest.</p>

<p>“My lord is very good and kind,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“And we must run down to Gloucestershire to have
a peep at your Hall.”</p>

<p>It was thus comfortably settled that Lois should remain
with the friends who had been so kind and considerate
to her.</p>

<p>“Does she care for anybody? or is she still heart-free?”
Lady Quaintree asked herself.</p>

<p>Almost unconsciously, the good lady was meditating
how she could find out without committing herself or
compromising her dignity.</p>

<p>If wit or diplomacy could manage it, she was resolved
on securing her favorite as a wife for her son, though a
couple of days before she would not have thanked the
soothsayer who might have told her that such an event
was looming in the future as a marriage between Lois
and Gerald.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">PAUL DESFRAYNE’S WIFE.</p>


<p>Lady Quaintree did not let excitement interfere with
her usual plans and daily arrangements. She had settled
that they should go on Saturday—the day after that one
so memorable in Lois’ life—to the Zoological Gardens to
hear the band play; and, accordingly, at about four
o’clock, she set off with Lois and her son in the carriage.</p>

<p>To Lois it all appeared as a dream. Everything was
the same, yet how different! Only a week ago had she
attended her patroness to this gay scene, then as her paid
if esteemed and indulged dependent. Now how was
everything altered! Her very attire proclaimed that the
tide of events had swept over her. She thought to keep
her head steady, to stand unchanged, but it was difficult.
It is as dangerous looking over an abyss clothed with
all the flowers of spring, illumined by the golden rays
of the morning sun, as to peer down from the black,
beetling brow of a precipice, jagged and repellent.</p>

<p>“Heaven!” she cried, half-shudderingly, in the depths
of her heart, “keep my soul pure and unspotted. Help
me to do my duty now, even if I have failed in the days
gone by.”</p>

<p>It was but too sweet for a beautiful girl of eighteen to
be suddenly paid so much court, to be coaxed to drink so
many a cup of nectar-tinctured flattery.</p>

<p>Great was the wonderment among the large circle of
Lady Quaintree’s friends and acquaintances at the magic
change in Miss Turquand’s status in society. No one
knew the stipulations in the old man’s will. It was only
known that she was now the happy possessor of a large
fortune, in lieu of being a penniless toiler in the world’s
hive.</p>

<p>That day Lois Turquand might have commanded a
dozen offers, some good, some bad, some indifferently
good. Many people speculated as to what would happen
next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“She was sure to marry at once,” everybody said. “Her
beauty, her money, and her romantic little history would
surely obtain for her the vivid interest of some more or
less eligible individual.”</p>

<p>The majority decided she would marry Gerald Danvers.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree had mentioned the projected visit to
the Zoo, in the hearing of Frank Amberley, and he was
haunting the gates when the little party arrived.</p>

<p>Poor fellow! He could not resist coming, fluttering
about the flame that might end by consuming him.</p>

<p>Gerald objected to his company, now that he had resolved
on appropriating the beautiful Lois himself. Hitherto
he had never really noticed how often or how long
Frank lingered by Miss Turquand. To-day he swelled
and fumed like some ruffled turkey-cock, as Frank persisted
in walking by the young girl’s left hand, as he displayed
the grace and elegance of his irreproachably
dressed person on her right.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree had meant to keep Lois near her own
side, but was obliged to loiter behind the three young
people, while a dowager friend poured some matronly
confidence into her unwilling ear.</p>

<p>It was a lovely afternoon, and the sun glittered down
his smiles on the gay throng, sitting in flowerlike groups,
or lingering over the sward.</p>

<p>The stroll was not a very lively one for the three somewhat
ill-matched companions. Frank Amberley’s heart
was full of despairing love and pain. Gerald Danvers
was in a downright rage. Lois felt worried and distrait.
The two young men wished each other at Jericho, or the
Arctic regions, and Miss Turquand would not have been
sorry to see herself quit of their uncongenial company.</p>

<p>At a sudden turn they came upon Captain Desfrayne,
who had just entered the gardens. He met them so unexpectedly
that Lois was taken by surprise, and so was
he. They stood for a moment staring at one another,
then Paul Desfrayne recollected himself, and lifted his
hat. Miss Turquand went through the conventional
obeisance.</p>

<p>A few words—what they were neither knew. Captain
Desfrayne exchanged courtesies for a brief moment with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
Frank Amberley, and bowed to Lady Quaintree, who was
only a short way in arrear. Then he vanished as quickly
as he had appeared.</p>

<p>The faint tinge of rose color on Lois Turquand’s cheeks
deepened visibly as she hurriedly passed on. A strange
kind of resentment rose up in her breast, and made her
eyes glitter with anger. At a second reflection, however,
reason came to her aid.</p>

<p>“It was not his fault,” she argued to herself, “that the
kind old man to whom I owe my good fortune made an
arrangement which is probably as distasteful to him as it
is to me. I must not blame him. In fact, I am very much
obliged to him, for I feel I should only be rude to him if
he tried to talk to me. I don’t believe I ever could like
him. He seems, though, to have pleasant, kindly eyes,
from the hasty glance I had.”</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne moved away as if from the vicinity of
the plague.</p>

<p>“Confound it!” he muttered, going he hardly knew
whither. “What bewitchingly lovely eyes that girl has,
though she is so cold and formal; what magnificent hair,
and the grace of a queen! I wish her better luck. Why
couldn’t the old man have left his money rationally, and
not make such a silly, preposterous, aggravating muddle
behind him! Well, after all, I have nobody to blame but
myself. My sins be on my own head; only I wish nobody
else had been dragged in. If it were not for my mother,
I should not care so much. Yet, after all, why need I
linger in this life of misery? Would it not be better—better
to stable my white elephant in the neighboring
mews, and so let my fatal secret out at once?”</p>

<p>He laughed aloud, cynically, bitterly.</p>

<p>Having escaped from the neighborhood of Lady Quaintree’s
party, he took a turn to ascertain if his mother was
in the gardens, for she had sent him a pressing message
to ask him to meet her; but finding that she had not,
apparently, arrived, he walked listlessly away at random.</p>

<p>Attracted by the solitary aspect of the quarter, he
roamed toward the place where the lions and tigers lay,
strode to and fro with stealthy step, or sat with magisterial
gravity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne had walked literally into the lion’s den.</p>

<p>A woman, young, strikingly handsome, dressed to perfection,
was standing in front of the center compartment.</p>

<p>Madam Lucia Guiscardini!</p>

<p>Had any one of the brutes strolled out of its den, and
held out a paw of greeting, the young man’s face could
scarcely have worn an expression of greater dismay.</p>

<p>Had it been possible, he would have retreated. But the
first sound of his firm, light step, made the superb Italian
turn.</p>

<p>A heavy frown darkened her perfectly beautiful countenance,
and she steadfastly gazed upon Captain Desfrayne
with much the same look as the dangerous animals at her
elbow had.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne raised his hat mechanically.</p>

<p>Madam Guiscardini took her small hands from off the
railing, where they had been placed with an odd sort of
grasp, and swept a curtsy almost ironical in its suavity.</p>

<p>The young man was obliged to advance, while Madam
Guiscardini would not move an inch from the spot where
she stood, continuing to gaze at him with that disagreeable,
mesmeric expression which so painfully resembled
the look of the wild beasts that made so suggestive a
background.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Madam Guiscardini,” said Paul Desfrayne,
folding his arms, as if to prepare himself for a
stormy interview.</p>

<p>“Did you come here to seek me, Paul Desfrayne?” she
inquired, regarding him with a baleful light in her splendid
eyes, defiance in every tone and gesture.</p>

<p>“To seek you!” bitterly repeated the young man. “I
would go to the end of the world to avoid you—you
who——”</p>

<p>“Come. It is a long time since we have met, and we
may be interrupted at any moment. If you have anything
to say to me, I am willing to go home now, and
either wait for you, or let you precede me. We have not
met since——”</p>

<p>“Since our wedding-morning,” Paul Desfrayne said,
as she paused. “Not for three years. I suppose you have
never seen me from that day until this moment?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>“I have never seen or heard of you,” she angrily retorted,
her eyes flashing ominously with premonitory
lightning. “I did not wish to see you. I did not care to
hear of you. I never asked a question about you. I
should not care if we never met again; and I should be
glad—<i>thankful</i> to hear you were dead.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” said Paul Desfrayne, again lifting his
hat. “If care, if regret, if bitter self-reproaches could
have killed, I should not have troubled you to-day. It
was, indeed, by no voluntary movement that I happened
to see you this afternoon. But I believe I must have
sought you ere long, to make some endeavor to arrive at
a state of things somewhat less wearying, somewhat less
wretched. My life is becoming a burden almost too heavy
to be borne.”</p>

<p>“You can see me any day you please to appoint,”
Madam Guiscardini said angrily. “I have no desire either
to seek or to avoid you. But I do not see what good
can come of talking. Nothing can undo what has been
done; nothing could roll back the waves of that pitiless
time that has swept over you and over me.”</p>

<p>“It remains to be seen what can be done, Madam Guiscardini,”
Captain Desfrayne answered, moving quite close
to her, and looking intently into her eyes. “Do you happen
ever to have seen, heard of, or personally known,
a man of the name of Gilardoni?”</p>

<p>The color faded completely from the cheeks, lips, almost
from the eyes, of the beautiful prima donna.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE PRIMA DONNA’S HATE.</p>


<p>Lucia Guiscardini clutched at the iron bar against
which she was half-leaning, and glared into the face of
her husband, as if she would read his innermost soul.</p>

<p>“What does he know?” she whispered to herself. “How
much does he know?”</p>

<p>There was a dead silence for a few seconds. The signs
of emotion caused by the name of the friendless wretch
who had sought his help were not lost upon Captain Desfrayne.</p>

<p>Madam Guiscardini was trying to rally her forces, and
she could not reply in words. Paul Desfrayne repeated
his inquiry in another form:</p>

<p>“You do know him?”</p>

<p>The half-terrified woman looked straight into his eyes—those
honest eyes, so full of natural kindness and honor.</p>

<p>Fear had blanched her cheeks and lips; shame, perhaps,
now drove the roseate hues in a flood back again, as she
answered, in a tolerably steady voice:</p>

<p>“I do not. I have never heard of him.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I don’t suppose my domestic affairs can possess
any interest for you, madam. It is merely a piece of egotistical
gossip to inform you that I have taken Leonardo
Gilardoni into my service.”</p>

<p>“Into your service?”</p>

<p>The words were pronounced slowly, with obvious difficulty,
and in a husky voice.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne did not evidence, by the slightest sign,
any triumph at the effect his unexpected shot had produced,
but silently watched her face.</p>

<p>“Why—why have you done so? I mean, why do you
tell me of it?”</p>

<p>“I cannot help having an idea that you knew something
of the poor fellow at one time, though he has slipped
from your memory,” Captain Desfrayne said, very calmly,
shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“Has he said—has he said——”</p>

<p>She could not continue; the effort at control was too
great.</p>

<p>It was impossible to tell how much this quiet, now half-smiling,
man before her might know of the terror that
haunted her day and night.</p>

<p>“Has he said <i>what</i>?” demanded Paul Desfrayne, looking
her steadily in the face.</p>

<p>“Said he knew me?” Madam Guiscardini coolly replied.</p>

<p>But as she spoke, her fingers so convulsively twitched,
as if she were trying her utmost to curb the secret emotions
of her mind, that they snapped the delicate, carved
ivory handle of her parasol.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne, who had not once removed his eyes
from her face, laughed cynically, bitterly. His laughter
had in it more of menace than an uncontrollable outburst
of violent anger.</p>

<p>He thought: “What can be the secret between them?”
But aloud he said, affecting to ignore the accidental betrayal
so direful as well as the agitation of his wife:</p>

<p>“He has barely mentioned your name, and then simply
in a passing way.”</p>

<p>“May I ask your reason for supposing I was acquainted
with him?”</p>

<p>“I had more reasons than one. But a chief reason
was that I knew he came from your part of Italy; and
in a village everybody knows everybody else. Had he
been an old friend of yours—don’t curl your lip: you
were once as lowly placed as he, perhaps more so—you
might perchance have cared to hear something of him.
The poor wretch has been in grievous adversity, it seems:
without a friend, often without a shelter, without money;
so it is probably a fortunate thing for him that he has
found a friend in me.”</p>

<p>“I hope he will serve you well,” said Madam Guiscardini,
in an ice-cold tone. “It shows good taste on the part
of Captain Desfrayne to recall the fact that the Guiscardini
was once a poor cottage girl in poverty—in——”</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed, and she stopped, as if afraid of rousing
her indomitable temper did she proceed. One sentence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
might ruin her. She abruptly curbed herself, and
swept another curtsy.</p>

<p>“I have the honor to wish Captain Desfrayne good
morning, and shall be ready to receive his promised—his
threatened visit——”</p>

<p>“On Monday afternoon,” Paul Desfrayne said sharply,
as if in positive pain. “I can endure this slavery—this
horrible bondage—no longer in silence.”</p>

<p>“On Monday afternoon be it. You know where to find
me?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not.”</p>

<p>Madam Guiscardini looked with intent suspicion at
him. She hated this handsome young man with concentrated
hate, but she respected him profoundly, and she
knew he would not utter a falsehood to gain a kingdom.
Therefore she was obliged to believe him, though she had
previously imagined that his presence in Porchester
Square had been due to some plot of which she was the
object.</p>

<p>She carefully watched him as she gave her address.
It was like a duel to the death, each adversary narrowly
eying the movements of the other. To her further mystification,
Paul Desfrayne almost sprang back in his
amazement when he heard her name the exact place where
she lived.</p>

<p>“Where?” he demanded, as if unable to credit his ears.</p>

<p>She coldly repeated the name of the square and the
number of the house.</p>

<p>“Why does he seem so astonished?” she said to herself,
eying him with a glance akin to that in the yellow
orbs of the leopardess a few steps from her. “What
is the matter now?”</p>

<p>“On Monday afternoon, then, we will have a further
explanation, Madam Guiscardini,” Paul Desfrayne said,
mastering his surprise, and raising his hat with the ceremony
he would have used to a total stranger.</p>

<p>He left her.</p>

<p>“Separated from my mother by a few layers of bricks
and mortar,” he thought. “I have appointed an interview,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
but what good can come of it? None. I have made
my bed—made it of thorns and briers, and must sleep
therein with what comfort I may.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders impatiently.</p>

<p>“What is to be done? It would be the best and wisest
course to immediately inform my mother of the exact
state of affairs. I wish I had done so at first. I am like
those very immoral little boys in the story-books of one’s
youth, who don’t tell in time, and so the agony goes
on piling up until the culprit is next to smothered. What
is to be done with this Gordian knot? I have not the
courage to cut it. I wonder they didn’t include moral
cowardice among the deadly sins. I wonder what would
be the consequences if I did summon up sufficient nerve
to inform my mother of my culpable behavior three years
ago? Come, Paul Desfrayne, it must be done. Better be
brave at once, and march up to the cannon’s mouth, than
be found out ignominiously some day sooner or later.
Shall it be done to-day—this evening?”</p>

<p>His reverie was broken by a light, caressing touch
upon his arm. Turning round suddenly, with a strange
sensation of nervous alarm, he found his mother by his
side.</p>

<p>Smiling, pleasant, unsuspicious, her sunny brow unclouded
by a shadow that might possibly produce a future
wrinkle, she looked deliciously happy, and perfectly confident,
to all appearance, of his trust and affection.</p>

<p>She started as he turned his face full upon her.</p>

<p>“You are pale, my dear. Are you not well?” she anxiously
inquired.</p>

<p>“Not very well, mother. The heat—the crowd—it is
such a bore altogether, that I am weary, and I should
be glad to escape.”</p>

<p>“My dear Paul, I have seen so little of you lately, that
I grudge to lose you when I have fairly secured a chance
of your company. But”—she glanced round at the gay,
ever-moving crowd, with its lively colors, at the faces,
dotted here and there, with which she was familiar, and
a faint smile dimpled the corners of her lips—“if you will,
let us go somewhere else. Where would you like to go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“Anywhere. I want a little talk with you—one of our
own old gossips, mother. It is impossible to obtain the
least chance of an uninterrupted talk here.”</p>

<p>Yet as he spoke, his heart sank within him. It seemed
as if his confession would be more difficult to-day than
ever. To make his path more thorny, that beloved face
looked so confiding, so sure that there could not be the
shadow of a secret, that it would have been a thousand
times easier to walk up to the cannon’s mouth, than to
speak the few words that must break forever the steady
bond linking them together.</p>

<p>But for all Mrs. Desfrayne’s calm, suave looks, she
was keenly watching her son. His absence alone had
hindered her from finding out long ago that some shadow
lay between them. Her practised, maternal eyes could
read him through.</p>

<p>“What has happened, and why is he afraid to tell me?”
she meditated, while to outward seeming engaged in regarding
the pleasant scene about her with half-childish
interest.</p>

<p>Her brain ran swiftly over every imaginable train of
events, possible or impossible, that might have happened,
seeking some clue to the evident mystery.</p>

<p>Not for a moment did her mind revert to what, after
all, was the most simple and obvious explanation.</p>

<p>They moved to quit the gardens.</p>

<p>“Is not that the Guiscardini?” she asked of Paul.</p>

<p>“I believe so.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne had put up her glass, so the look and
tone with which her inquiry was answered escaped her.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why,” she continued; “but I have taken
an inveterate dislike to that woman. She reminds me of
a magnificent cobra. You know, Paul, I have a foolish
way of taking likes and dislikes.”</p>

<p>At the next step she encountered Miss Turquand.</p>

<p>In spite of her resolve to cultivate the young girl’s
friendship, a cold inclination of the head was all that
passed between them.</p>

<p>A warmer salutation to Lady Quaintree followed, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Mrs. Desfrayne was too impatient to hear what her son
had to say, to be able to stop just then for a little idle,
sunshiny gossip.</p>

<p>Paul handed her into the brougham that was in waiting.</p>

<p>It was a hired one, as Mrs. Desfrayne always remembered
as she was about to enter it. She had longed for
the days when either by some brilliant matrimonial stroke
on her own part, or that of her son, she should be the
happy possessor of such carriages and horses as might
please her fancy. Yet now she was secretly determined
to hinder, if possible, her son’s acceptance of a fortune
that far exceeded her most sanguine dreams.</p>

<p>With anxiety she regarded Paul’s face as he seated
himself beside her. He was ashy pale, and his eyes were
bright with the brightness of fever.</p>

<p>“Home,” she said to the coachman.</p>

<p>Too wary to hasten the unwilling confession by ill-timed
or injudicious questions, Mrs. Desfrayne nestled
back in her cozy corner, and began to flirt her garden-fan,
waiting patiently.</p>

<p>It is always the first step that forms the difficulty, and
even yet Paul could not resolve on precipitating himself
into those cold waters he so dreaded. Even did he take
the plunge, how could he introduce the subject?</p>

<p>The drive passed, therefore, in constrained silence.</p>

<p>It was not until they were seated in the cool, pleasant
room, called by Mrs. Desfrayne her own special retreat,
that Paul could break the ice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne gazed with wonderment at the handsome
face of her boy, as he sat on a low chair before her,
his eyes cast down, his hands nervously playing with the
silken fringe on her dress, so unlike what she had ever
known him before.</p>

<p>“Paul,” she said softly, leaning toward him, “you look
like a criminal. What is the matter with you?”</p>

<p>The tone was mellow and tender, and yet with a tinge
of gentle gaiety.</p>

<p>Paul raised his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>“Like a criminal?” he repeated slowly. “I look like
what I am. Oh! my mother—my mother!”</p>

<p>He slipped from the low chair, on his knees, and bowed
his face on his mother’s hands. She felt hot tears wet her
fingers, and a great terror seized her heart, for she adored
her boy.</p>

<p>“Paul,” she whispered, “tell me what has happened!”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">PAUL DESFRAYNE’S CONFESSION.</p>


<p>Paul Desfrayne’s weakness did not last many minutes.</p>

<p>Rising to his feet, he strode backward and forward
half a dozen times; then, pausing, he leaned his folded
arms on the back of the low, carved chair into which he
had at first thrown himself.</p>

<p>“You alarm me, Paul. I beseech you, tell me the worst
at once,” implored his mother.</p>

<p>“You may see with what an effort I try to approach the
secret which, for three long years, has been my curse
by day and by night,” answered Paul mournfully.</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne threw out her hands with an involuntary
gesture of fear and amazement.</p>

<p>“For three years!” she repeated, as if incredulous.</p>

<p>“What do you imagine that secret to have been?” he
demanded, gazing steadfastly at her.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! how can I imagine when, until this
moment, I did not know you had any concealment from
me at all?” exclaimed Mrs. Desfrayne.</p>

<p>Her accent was indicative half of despair, half of keen
reproach.</p>

<p>“As you are aware, I have just received a most singular
offer.”</p>

<p>“Your troubles, then, have some reference to Lois Turquand?”</p>

<p>“In a measure, yes. You would wish me, if I understood
you aright, to take advantage, as far as in me lay,
of this offer?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne hesitated, then cried, with vehemence:</p>

<p>“Why do you not speak plainly at once, instead of
harassing me by these hints and half-confidences?”</p>

<p>“Because I am afraid of the effect upon you; because
I am afraid you may never be able to forgive me.”</p>

<p>“For what offense?”</p>

<p>“For deceit and ingratitude toward the best and kindest
of mothers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“It is impossible to comprehend you. I must only wait
for some key to your singular self-reproaches,” said Mrs.
Desfrayne, with a profound sigh.</p>

<p>“Three years ago I went for a holiday tour to Italy,
when you were with some friends at Wiesbaden.”</p>

<p>“I recollect perfectly well. I was disappointed because
you would not join us.”</p>

<p>“Would to Heaven I had yielded to your wishes!”</p>

<p>“From that time I have scarcely seen anything of you,
Paul. You have visited me by fits and starts, and have
never stayed long.”</p>

<p>As she spoke, an idea darted into Mrs. Desfrayne’s
mind.</p>

<p>“After traveling about in various parts of Italy, as I
kept you informed by my letters, I reached Florence.”</p>

<p>His lips trembled as he pronounced the name of the city
which bore so many painful memories for him.</p>

<p>“Go on, my dear.”</p>

<p>“I remained at Florence for several weeks. While
there, I went every night to the opera.”</p>

<p>“A very agreeable manner of spending your evenings,”
said Mrs. Desfrayne, with assumed carelessness.</p>

<p>“There was an excellent company, and the operas were
admirably selected; but I did not go for the sake of either
performers or pieces: I went, drawn thither as by a lodestone,
because I was under some kind of strange hallucination
that I was in love with a young girl who had just
come out there. Perhaps I may have been in love with
her. It was folly—a madness!”</p>

<p>There was no sign of emotion on Mrs. Desfrayne’s
face. She sat almost immovable as a statue, her hands
loosely clasped as they rested in her lap, her wide-open,
glowing eyes alone betraying the painful interest she felt
in her son’s words.</p>

<p>“For some days and nights I blindly worshiped this
dazzling star from a distance,” Paul continued, having
vainly waited for some remark from his mother. “At last
I was introduced to her. She lived with some elderly
female relative, who accompanied her to the theater every
night. By degrees—very rapid degrees, for Italian girls
are very unlike their English sisters—she made me her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
confidant. She did with me as she chose. For all I knew
of her real nature, she might as well have worn a waxen
mask. Through the dishonesty of the man who had
trained her, she had been sold into a species of slavery
to the manager. Unaware of her own value, she had
bound herself to this fellow’s exclusive service for the
term of ten years, at a salary which the most subordinate
performer would have refused with scorn.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said his mother, on whom the truth began
to force itself.</p>

<p>“Infatuated as I was, she easily interested me in her
story, although I had at that time no intentions of any
kind beyond——”</p>

<p>“Beyond flirting with the girl?”</p>

<p>“I floated with the current. I was incapable of reasoning,
as much so as any one bereft of their natural senses.
One night I was behind the scenes; the house took fire.
There was a fearful panic, and hundreds were injured—many
killed. This young girl clung to me, and somehow
I carried her out of the theater by the stage-door—I
believe so, for I remembered nothing from the time I
caught her up in my arms until a moment of amazed
weakness, when I woke up to find myself lying in a
strange room, this girl sitting by me. I then learned
that, as I rushed out, bearing her in my arms, a blazing
beam of timber had fallen, and dangerously wounded
me.”</p>

<p>An exclamation escaped Mrs. Desfrayne, and she half-rose
from her seat.</p>

<p>“What am I to hear?” she cried, as if in anguish.
“And you never told me of this illness!”</p>

<p>“Let me finish, now that I have begun. I had been ill
for weeks in the old home on the outskirts of Florence,
where this girl lived, with her aged attendant or relative.
Unhappily—most unhappily—they both imagined
I was an English milord. I believe that my servant had
deceived them by bragging of my wealth and importance.”</p>

<p>“How did he dare to permit you to remain in that
place instead of having you carried to your own lodgings?”
demanded Mrs. Desfrayne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“When I fell, the girl and I were put into some kind
of vehicle, and she took me to her own home. Her object
was, I believe, to have me under the immediate
pressure of her influence. When Reynolds, my servant,
heard of what had occurred, he flew to my side; but the
physician who attended me would not, or could not, hear
of my removal. Reynolds, poor soul, was seized, a day
or two after, with a fever, from which he did not recover
for months.”</p>

<p>“I see now the drift of your history,” said Mrs. Desfrayne,
in a tone which showed that she was wounded
to the depths of her heart. “It is the hackneyed story of
the young man who falls ill marrying the handsome young
woman who nurses him.”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne turned aside, and took a hasty stride
to and fro; then he returned, resuming his position.</p>

<p>“She was, or pretended to be, full of joy and gratitude
on my recovery. During the days of my convalescence,
she spoke to me fully of her state of bondage, her anger
at the injustice done her, her desire for liberty, and affected
to make no secret of what she averred was desperate
love for myself. My sympathies were enlisted for her;
my vanity was aroused in her favor. I at length——”</p>

<p>“Asked her to marry you?” laughed his mother.</p>

<p>“No. Her agreement with the manager bound her for
ten years, under a heavy penalty. I desired that she
should leave the stage, although I felt it would be next
to an impossibility to marry this girl. I remembered your
strong prejudices against stage-performers——”</p>

<p>“Ah! You did think of me once.”</p>

<p>“I rarely forgot you in my most insane moments. I
thought of my position, of the traditions of my family.
I would have freed her if I could, and then fled her presence;
for I felt it would be impossible to make this girl
your daughter, though her name was stainless, and she
was superbly beautiful, and gifted with talents of a certain
kind. But I could not rescue her by money from the
clutches of the old wolf who had laid a claw upon her.
It would have needed thousands, and I should perhaps
have left myself penniless, and—and looking very like a
fool,” Paul added, with a cynical laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“You married the girl, then?” said Mrs. Desfrayne
eagerly, anxious to ascertain the exact position of her
son, and desirous of hurrying him to an immediate acknowledgment.</p>

<p>“I offered to assist her in taking flight to Paris. At
least, I believed the suggestion was mine, but later I recollected
that the entire plan was arranged by herself, under
advice of the old woman who attended her. She was
restless and impatient until we had completed every preparation
to leave Florence forever, as she intended. I
cannot realize how it came about that I was like a puppet
in her hands.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne shrugged her shoulders with a kind of
disdainful compassion.</p>

<p>“We started late on a Friday, the opera being closed
on that night, and arrived safely at the frontier. Then
we suddenly discovered that the old woman had not been
provided with a passport. The girl whom I had undertaken
to assist wept and sobbed with terror.”</p>

<p>“A preconcerted affair, my poor Paul.”</p>

<p>“No doubt. We agreed that there was nothing to be
done but to leave the old attendant behind with money
and instructions to follow as early as she possibly could,
and then to pursue our journey. For more than a week
we continued our flight. It seemed to me then more like
a strange, fascinating dream, than an incident of my real
every-day life. I fell more and more under the spell of
this beautiful siren’s beauty and insidious charm of manner,
and by the time we reached Paris I had completely
lost my senses. About three days after we reached our
destination, I made her my wife; we were married at the
British embassy.”</p>

<p>Paul’s mother clasped her hands with a cry. The
point at which she had desired to arrive even now electrified
her. She could not have explained her own feelings
at that moment. Her brain seemed in a whirl from the
shock. The story gave her the idea that it was like one
of those fantastical dreams, where all the personages who
appear perform the most improbable tricks, and everybody
apparently does the most unlikely acts.</p>

<p>“May I inquire the name of this amiable young person?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
she asked, and her own voice struck her as being
strange.</p>

<p>“It is already known to you,” answered Paul, in hollow
tones. “But I will mention it when I have finished my
narration. We were married. The ceremony over, we
returned to the hotel where I had placed her, and where
I had likewise taken up my abode. Within an hour after
this fatal bond had been tied, an accidental observation
on my part revealed to her the fact that I was <i>not</i> the
rich and titled man she had supposed me to be. I had
asked her to relinquish the stage as a profession, and she
laughingly answered that as the wife of a great English
milord it would be impossible for her to continue the
career to which she had meant to devote her life. I was
confounded at the mistake into which she had so unhappily
fallen, and endeavored to explain my real position
to her.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne tapped her foot on the carpet with such
violence that Paul stopped.</p>

<p>“Go on—go on—go on!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“This girl, whom I up to that moment had had the
fatuity to imagine loved me for myself alone, went on in
an ecstasy dilating on the future splendors of her lot.
I at length succeeded in inducing her to listen to me.
Then I laid before her the realities of my position, my
limited income, the quietude of the life she would be
obliged to lead. I spoke of you——”</p>

<p>“How dared you speak of me to a person like that?”
furiously asked Mrs. Desfrayne.</p>

<p>“I—well, enough. If blamelessness of life, an unspotted
name, could have atoned for other sins, even you,
mother, must have granted her absolution. Enough. She
was compelled to believe that she had made a most fearful
mistake—she was like a tiger who—— My mother,
it had been well for us—for many others—if that revelation
could have come an hour before, instead of an hour
after, our ill-starred union. The scene I never can forget.
Sometimes in the dead hours of the night I am
startled awake by the fancy that I am again going through
it. I wonder, after the successive shocks of those few
weeks, that I now live to give you the miserable recital.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>Again he paced to and fro, as if in almost uncontrollable
emotion. This time, on again pausing, he sank into
the chair as if almost exhausted.</p>

<p>His mother made no sign. The bitterness of her anger
and disappointment exceeded, if that were possible, his
darkest forebodings.</p>

<p>She continued to tap her foot on the carpet, and her
jeweled fingers twined and twisted in one another as if
they must snap. This time she addressed no inquiry to
him, but sat a silent image of despair and mortified anger.</p>

<p>“Let me make an end of my story as quickly as I can,”
Paul said, in subdued tones. He heartily wished now he
had let it still remain untold until such a time as he might
be driven to confess it. “La Lucia, after storming and
raging, registered a mighty oath never to see my face
again if she could help herself, never to carry into effect
the vows she had made at the altar—to hold herself free
as if she had never seen me. I can hardly tell you what
she said. She ironically thanked me for having helped
her to escape from one kind of slavery, though she found
herself trammeled in another, and for my care of her during
the journey, and for the consideration and delicate
courtesy I had shown her in her unprotected state, and
then swept out of the room. The next thing I heard
of my lady wife was that she had carried herself and all
her belongings off from the hotel. I never heard of her
again until Europe was ringing with her name and
fame.”</p>

<p>“Her name?” repeated Mrs. Desfrayne mechanically.</p>

<p>“The name I had first known her under.”</p>

<p>“And that was?”</p>

<p>“Lucia Guiscardini.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne sprang from her seat, and began pacing
to and fro in her turn.</p>

<p>“Oh! it is too much—too much!” she cried. “Ungrateful,
wicked, unloving son, is it thus you have returned
the deep, unwearying affection I have ever cherished for
you?”</p>

<p>“The most bitter reproaches you can level at me can
never equal in intensity those which I have heaped on
my own head,” Paul replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“You must have been mad to let yourself be entrapped
in this way,” Mrs. Desfrayne went on. “I can scarcely
believe it is true. You are, then, really bound to this—this
singing woman who cares nothing for you, who
seems to disdain you and all belonging to you. Oh! it is
incredible. And what about Miss Turquand?”</p>

<p>“I know not,” answered Paul wearily. “I wish to
Heaven I had never seen or heard of the eccentric old
fogy who chose to imagine himself under some debt of
gratitude to me, for then——”</p>

<p>“Folly!” angrily interrupted his mother. “Better wish
you had never seen this woman who owns you—or that
you had not been so——”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders with an expression indescribable.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause.</p>

<p>“It would be as ridiculous as it would be undignified
on my part to display any resentment against you,” Mrs.
Desfrayne resumed. “Of course, you had a right to
please yourself: though married in haste, you are repenting
at leisure. But what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! so long as that woman lives, there is
not a ray of happiness for you.”</p>

<p>“I know it. It is a heavy penalty to pay for those few
weeks of forgetfulness, of lunacy, of fever; but hardly
so heavy to bear as the loss of the love and esteem of the
only woman in the world I ever loved, or am likely to
love.”</p>

<p>“Whom are you talking about?” hastily demanded Mrs.
Desfrayne, a new spasm of jealousy seizing her heart.</p>

<p>But Paul would not answer.</p>

<p>He rested his arms on the back of the chair, and laid
his head on the support thus made. This attitude brought
vividly back to his mother’s mind the days of his childhood
and youth, when he had been all her own. How
often had she seen him thus, when he had been guilty
of some youthful fault or folly, and was penitent, yet
half-afraid he should not easily find pardon!</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne’s heart was irresistibly drawn toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
her boy. With a soft, gentle touch, she laid one of her
white, jeweled hands on his head.</p>

<p>“Do you speak of me?” she asked. “Ah! Paul, it is
ten thousand pities that, having committed this fatal mistake,
you did not confide in me before. What a miserable
future is before you; but you must not give way. It
must be borne. I do not reproach you. Nay, I will give
you such comfort as I can.”</p>

<p>Paul caught her hands, and covered them with kisses.</p>

<p>“Would that I had—would that I had told you, mother!”
he cried, looking up into her face with his open, candid
eyes, from which some of the black care had melted.
“That terrible secret has stood between me and you like
some malignant black specter.”</p>

<p>“I dimly felt its presence now and again,” said his
mother, “though I could not believe it possible you could
deceive me. But tell me, what do you mean to do?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. What can I do?”</p>

<p>“True.”</p>

<p>“As for this young lady, why, I am sorry she will be
driven to think ill of me; but any explanation would be
clearly impossible. She will have a handsome fortune in
any case, and probably marry some one infinitely more to
her taste than I should be. In two or three days my leave
of absence expires, and I go to rejoin my regiment near
Gloucester.”</p>

<p>“I no sooner see you again than you are snatched away.
It is hard, Paul.”</p>

<p>“Just at this juncture perhaps it will be better for me
to be out of your way. You will think more kindly of
your absent son and his faults and follies than you might
of——”</p>

<p>“Come. Let us put away that painful subject, and not
recur to it unless necessary. Of course, it is of no earthly
use your giving another thought to this Miss Turquand.”</p>

<p>“I think it would be as well to confide my exact position
to the lawyer who drew up the will, and who introduced
me to the young lady yesterday evening—Amberley.
I think I mentioned his name to you. He might be
able to give me a dispassionate word of advice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne considered.</p>

<p>“You see, my dearest mother, he would be able to look
at the matter from a mere business point of view, as he
has no interest in the affair.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” Mrs. Desfrayne slowly said, “it might be
as well to consult him. I think I have met him at Lady
Quaintree’s. Yes, it would perhaps be best to speak to
him about your most unhappy position.”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne rose, and went over to his mother’s
little writing-table. As if afraid to trust to his continuance
of purpose, he sat down and wrote a few lines to
Frank Amberley, asking him to make an appointment, as
he desired to consult him on a matter of importance.</p>

<p>He showed the note to his mother, enclosed it then in an
envelope, addressed and stamped it, leaving it on the desk
ready for the post.</p>

<p>The ordeal he had so dreaded had been passed through.
The terrible secret had been revealed. Now he wished
he had spoken of it long ago.</p>

<p>“You are going to Gloucester? When?”</p>

<p>“On Wednesday. The regiment is stationed at Holston,
some miles from Gloucester.”</p>

<p>“Holston? Why, is not that near the place where
Flore Hall is situated?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I look forward to going over the old house
once more as one of the few pleasures in store for me
down there. I feel thankful to get away now.”</p>

<p>Neither Captain Desfrayne nor his mother knew that
the old Hall in which he had spent so many days of his
childhood had been left to Lois Turquand by her dead
benefactor.</p>

<p>The storm had passed, leaving but little trace behind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Desfrayne easily persuaded her son to remain for
the rest of the evening with her.</p>

<p>On Wednesday Captain Desfrayne was to go to
Gloucester.</p>

<p>On Monday he was to visit Madam Guiscardini, according
to the appointment made in the gardens, though
it seemed worse than useless to renew the pain and distress
he had suffered that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>His mother was passionately averse to his seeing the
woman who had so fatally entrapped him.</p>

<p>“Nay, mother; it will be best to ascertain clearly how
we are to spend our future lives,” Paul said. “We must
come to a clear understanding some way.”</p>

<p>On reaching home, he found a letter from Frank Amberley,
dated that morning, before his own had been written,
asking if it would be convenient for him to attend on
Tuesday a meeting of the partners of the firm, to go more
fully into the details of business having reference to Miss
Turquand’s affairs.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne saw it would not be so easy to shrink
from his duties as sole trustee and executor to the beautiful
Lois as he had hoped it might be.</p>

<p>As he drifted into a broken, uneasy slumber that night,
his last thoughts turned upon Lois, sincerely trusting it
might not be necessary for the young girl to attend the
meeting.</p>

<p>Why should he have this fear—this undercurrent of
aversion to encountering his beautiful charge?</p>

<p>He had seen her only twice. He persuaded himself she
was cold and beautiful as an antique statue. He argued
to himself that a world-worn, half-weary man of thirty
could scarcely be acceptable to a young girl of eighteen.
He chose to feel certain that being dictated to in her
choice must of itself suffice to render him unwelcome.</p>

<p>And yet he shrank with vague terror at the chance of
being again exposed to the danger of being obliged to
look into those soft, crystal-bright eyes, of glancing even
for a moment into those untroubled depths, where lay
mirrored the most perfect purity, loyalty, and truth.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">FRANK AMBERLEY’S EXULTATION.</p>


<p>Lucia Guiscardini was determined not to come face
to face again with Paul Desfrayne if she could help it.</p>

<p>The evening of the day she saw him by accident at the
Zoological Gardens, she was obliged to appear at the
opera.</p>

<p>Never, perhaps, had she performed more resplendently,
yet all the time she was meditating how to escape a
second interview.</p>

<p>She settled the matter after her own fashion.</p>

<p>Ordering her maid to pack up a few necessary things,
she started by the midnight train for Paris.</p>

<p>“I hate him,” she said to herself, as she sank back
into a dim corner in the first-class carriage as it rattled
away from Charing Cross; “and I would kill him if I
could, and if I thought nobody could find it out. What
a weak fool I must have been! But I was in too great
a hurry to secure what I rashly imagined to be a splendid
prize. And to think that I might be a princess if I were
not tied by this hateful bond! Women have crushed others
before for less cause.”</p>

<p>The consequence was, that when Paul Desfrayne called
at the house so strangely contiguous to that in which his
mother dwelt, he was informed that madam was not in
town.</p>

<p>“Not in town?” he repeated, with amazement.</p>

<p>Further inquiries elicited that madam had gone away
rather suddenly—gone to Paris, the man believed, and
had not left word when she might return.</p>

<p>With a sense of almost relief, Paul turned away. Just
then he was glad of a reprieve, for he felt little equal to
much more violent emotion.</p>

<p>He was infinitely relieved, too, by finding that Miss
Turquand’s presence had not been considered necessary
at the business meeting in Alderman’s Lane.</p>

<p>The young lady had been taken down to the country,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
one of the partners informed him, by Lady Quaintree, the
day before, to visit the mansion and grounds left by the
testator.</p>

<p>“As you are aware, Captain Desfrayne, having read
the will, all the landed estates and house property have
been left solely for the use and benefit of Miss Turquand,”
remarked Mr. Salmon, a tall, large, white-headed
gentleman, of a jovial deportment and cheerful manners.</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne bowed. He had indeed seen as
much in the terrible document; but, being preoccupied by
the vexatious clauses respecting the planned union between
himself and Lois Turquand, had not paid much
heed to the minor details.</p>

<p>“The principal country house is, I understand, a very
handsome and substantial place,” Mr. Salmon continued,
jingling his seals musically. “I think it is situated in
Gloucestershire,” he added, looking at Frank Amberley.</p>

<p>“Flore Hall, Holston, some miles from Gloucester,”
Frank Amberley replied.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne could scarcely credit his ears. He had
congratulated himself on the hope of escape, and now it
seemed he would be driven to walk into the very jaws
of danger.</p>

<p>“Did I understand you to say that Miss Turquand has
gone to visit Flore Hall?” he asked of Frank Amberley.</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>Paul had the greatest difficulty in restraining himself
from demanding how long she would be likely to stay
there.</p>

<p>He felt much like one of those unhappy criminals who
have been immured in a dungeon, the walls of which slowly
close in and crush them.</p>

<p>Like one in a painful dream, he listened as affairs were
laid before him, and dry, legal questions raised and discussed.</p>

<p>Every moment he resolved to plainly tell these calm,
legal gentlemen how he was situated, or else to distinctly
give them to understand that he would not undertake
the responsibility.</p>

<p>Perhaps he was chiefly deterred by a vague feeling that
he might place himself in a ridiculous position. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
one thing to kneel, as it were, at the feet of a mother,
who might display either anger or sympathy, but would
certainly be able to comprehend his wild story; but quite
another to unveil his heart-secrets to the cool, critical eyes
of those hard-headed, tranquil men of the law.</p>

<p>The partners, observing his wearied air, his total lack
of interest, his abstracted replies, settled each mentally
that Captain Desfrayne was not much of a man of business.</p>

<p>Frank Amberley alone watched him narrowly.</p>

<p>“He is not mercenary, that is clear,” Mr. Amberley
thought. “What are his secret motives or reasons for
such strange behavior?”</p>

<p>The interview ended, and Paul Desfrayne had made no
sign, save of acquiescence.</p>

<p>Papers, memoranda of various kinds, deeds, leases, and
other dry reading had been gone through, only bringing
to him a bad headache.</p>

<p>At last he found himself in Frank Amberley’s private
room, and free to confide as much or as little as he pleased
to the man who was his secret rival.</p>

<p>“You wished to consult me on important business, I
believe?” Mr. Amberley said, when they were alone.</p>

<p>“I did, if you will be kind enough to listen to me.”</p>

<p>There was a long and painful pause.</p>

<p>Frank Amberley had a presentiment that Captain Desfrayne
was about to give him some clue to his reasons
for shunning Lois Turquand. He did not utter a word,
but began to sort some papers, to leave his visitor free to
collect his thoughts.</p>

<p>“The fact is,” Captain Desfrayne began slowly, “I
am placed in a most embarrassing situation. I find myself
bound, in a measure, to make love to a young, beautiful,
and wealthy lady, and bribed magnificently to try and
win her, involving her in pecuniary loss if I fail to gain
her hand and heart, when——”</p>

<p>“You speak as if something interfered to hinder you
from carrying out the agreeable wishes of the late Mr.
Vere Gardiner.”</p>

<p>“The strongest possible reason hinders me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“You would not allude to a hindrance were it not your
intention to enlighten me.”</p>

<p>“The hindrance is the most valid and insuperable one
that could exist. I am already married!”</p>

<p>Frank Amberley pushed his chair back the few inches
that intervened between him and the wall behind, and
stared at Captain Desfrayne.</p>

<p>“Already married!” he repeated. “Impossible! You
are jesting, surely? Pardon me, I am so much surprised
that I scarcely know what I am saying. May I ask why
you did not mention this important fact earlier?”</p>

<p>“The subject is a most painful one, for I must frankly
confess to you that my marriage has been a most unhappy
one, and has never been publicly acknowledged.”</p>

<p>A thrill of joy ran through Frank Amberley’s heart.
Although he could scarcely hope to win the beautiful object
of his passionate love and devotion, at least this stupendous
stumbling-block was removed out of the path.</p>

<p>“Am I at liberty to inform the partners of the firm of
this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I suppose they must learn it sooner or later,” Paul
Desfrayne answered, with a deep sigh. “Therefore, I
leave the matter in your hands. I trust in your kindness
and discretion not to let it be more fully known than may
be absolutely necessary.”</p>

<p>“Miss Turquand ought to be informed of the state
of affairs.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will be good enough to undertake the
task?”</p>

<p>“A sufficiently unpleasant one.”</p>

<p>“Why so? To me it would be an impossibility; but to
you——”</p>

<p>“It will be a mere matter of business,” Frank Amberley
remarked, as Captain Desfrayne hesitated. A slight
grimace which passed over his countenance might have
served to mark the words as ironical; but it came and
went unnoticed. “Be it so. When Miss Turquand returns,
I will take care she is duly informed of the fact
which you have confided to me. She would, perhaps, be
better pleased if the information came from yourself, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
as you are so averse to seeing her on the subject, why, I
must simply do as you wish.”</p>

<p>“The sooner she knows the better.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Mr. Amberley, as if another idea had occurred
to him, “I think you mentioned just now, when
down-stairs, that you were about to start for Gloucestershire,
to join your regiment. I thought you told Mr.
Salmon that you were going to Holston to-morrow, if I
understood rightly?”</p>

<p>“Quite true.”</p>

<p>“I have never visited the neighborhood; but if you are
anywhere near Flore Hall”—he hesitated—“the probabilities
are that you may see Miss Turquand before I
do. I have no idea how long she will remain at Holston,
and did not know a visit was contemplated: I heard of it
by accident this morning.”</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne reflected. Unhappily, his meditations
were neither of an agreeable nor a profitable nature.</p>

<p>“True,” he slowly replied, speaking as if with difficulty.
“I will not seek Miss Turquand—I cannot; you must
bear with what may seem like culpable weakness; but if I
should meet her——”</p>

<p>“I quite understand your situation and feelings, and I
hope you will treat me as a friend,” said Frank Amberley.
“I will do what I can for you; and, believe me, I
sympathize with you. Let me know if there should be
any explanation between you and the young lady, and if
you do not find a good opportunity for speaking to her on
the subject, I will undertake to act for you.”</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne looked into those kindly, truthful eyes,
and held out his hand, as if to mutely express his gratitude.
Then, after a few more words, he departed, wearily.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” Frank Amberley thought. “They may
well paint fortune as blind. Yesterday I envied him—to-day
I cannot but pity him. So this, then, is the secret.
Poor soul! what a burden to bear.”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne found, on returning home, that
Leonardo Gilardoni had arranged everything perfectly,
for the migration of the following day.</p>

<p>He wished to mention to the Italian that Madam Guiscardini<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
had abruptly quitted London, for the sake of observing
the effect the news might have, but he could not
bring himself voluntarily to pronounce her name.</p>

<p>On the Wednesday morning, he started for Holston,
having bade his mother farewell. He had spent Monday
and Tuesday evening with her, and promised to write frequently.</p>

<p>After all, the old links did not seem to be so broken
as he had feared they would be, and his mother still appeared
as she had ever done, all affection and maternal
solicitude.</p>

<p>She had some friends in the neighborhood of Holston,
and looked forward to being able to obtain an invitation
for some weeks there.</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne mentioned the discovery that Miss
Turquand had come into possession of Flore Hall—a
discovery that little gratified Mrs. Desfrayne, for the old
country-seat had belonged to one of her uncles, who had
been ruined by his extravagance.</p>

<p>Probably she would not have been more pleased had
any wee bird whispered to her that Lois Turquand’s
mother had been lady’s-maid within its walls to the wife
of that selfsame wasteful relative. Mr. Vere Gardiner
had, in truth, purchased the house and the land belonging
to it in the hope of being able to gratify his old love by
installing her as mistress where she had once been simply
a paid servant.</p>

<p>“There is a fate in it all,” Mrs. Desfrayne said. “How
will it end?”</p>

<p>“How should it end, mother?” Paul replied, somewhat
sharply. “I suppose we have pretty well seen the end of
these unpleasant affairs. The worst has passed.”</p>

<p>Poor fellow! the most bitter draft was yet to come.
The end of his fantastical life-story was very far from
view.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE MISTRESS OF FLORE HALL.</p>


<p>Lady Quaintree had taken a fancy into her head that
she should like to see the old Hall which now owned
Miss Lois Turquand as proprietress. Therefore, she carried
off the young girl, her maid, and a couple of male
servants, on a hasty expedition.</p>

<p>“We will not send word we are coming, my dear,”
she half-suggested, half-commanded. “It will be most
advisable to seize the people who have the care of the
place by surprise.”</p>

<p>Her ladyship knew nothing of the fact that Mrs. Turquand
had once lived at Flore Hall in service. Lois had
never heard her mother refer to her girl days, and was
equally ignorant with Lady Quaintree that the almost elegant,
proud woman she remembered as her mother had
originally occupied so obscure and humble a position as
lady’s-maid to a country squire’s wife.</p>

<p>“We must engage a maid for you, my love,” said Lady
Quaintree. “It will be impossible for you to manage
without one.”</p>

<p>Lois laughed with some gaiety, but did not answer.</p>

<p>The journey was easily performed, without adventure.
The way was as pleasant as sunny skies, beautiful, constantly
changing scenery, and easy transit could render it.</p>

<p>On arriving at Holston, in the evening, Lady Quaintree
found a carriage waiting at the station, for she had sent
intelligence of her advent to some friends in the vicinity,
and piqued their curiosity by hints of the beauty and romantic
history of a charming young friend she was bringing
with her.</p>

<p>Not only a carriage, but a very pretty girl waited the
arrival of the expected guests. This girl was the daughter
of the old friends to whom Lady Quaintree was going
to pay what she had called “a flying visit.” She was
in the waiting-room, a bare, wooden-benched nook, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
her presence seemed like the veriest sunshine in a shady
place.</p>

<p>She was watching from the window, and ran out on
the platform when she saw her old friend alight.</p>

<p>A tall, symmetrically formed figure, attired in a coquettish
style, a fair, laughing face, enframed in a golden
shower of tangled curls, with blue, or, rather, violet eyes,
carnation lips, the most dazzlingly white little pearly
teeth, small hands, and dainty, arched feet, shod in high-heeled
shoes with gleaming buckles—such would be very
crude notes for a description of Blanche Dormer.</p>

<p>The train swept onward, and in a moment the platform
was again silent and deserted, leaving Miss Dormer
free to indulge in her evidently impulsive nature, by kissing
and embracing Lady Quaintree in a very ardent manner.
Lady Quaintree could have pardoned her for a little
less show of affection, her ladyship being somewhat
averse to being made so free with.</p>

<p>“Dearest Lady Quaintree,” cried this young lady, her
voice ringing like musical bells, “I am so glad to see you!
Mama would have come to meet you, but she is not very
well. Papa had to go to dine with Sir Charles Devereux,
or he would have come. I have not seen you since those
delightful days three years ago, when we had such a
delicious ‘time,’ as the Americans say, at that old German
<i>bade</i>.”</p>

<p>“My dear, I have brought you a friend—Miss Lois
Turquand,” said Lady Quaintree, with gentle dignity.
“I hope you two girls will like one another.”</p>

<p>The girls looked into one another’s eyes, and then simultaneously
obeyed some mysterious impulse by clasping
hands.</p>

<p>“You two were little girls when I last saw you, Miss
Blanche,” Lady Quaintree said, as they descended the
stairs to enter the carriage.</p>

<p>“I was sixteen, your ladyship,” protested Blanche. “I
am nineteen now.”</p>

<p>“Ah! well. Fifteen or sixteen, I suppose, is very young
and childish to an old lady like me,” smiled her ladyship.</p>

<p>On their way to The Cedars, the carriage passed the
barracks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>Blanche eagerly directed the attention of her companions
to the place, and informed them that the present occupants
were to leave on the morrow, and a fresh regiment
was to be installed on Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree politely suppressed a yawn, and
thought with mild wonderment of how easily interested
in small objects country people were. Lois listened with
equal indifference, studying the captivating lights and
shadows on her new friend’s face.</p>

<p>Neither knew that it was the regiment to which Paul
Desfrayne belonged that was expected.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dormer was a delightful, somewhat old-fashioned
type of the country lady. Her manners were as free and
as heartily cordial as those of her daughter, but yet, like
Blanche, she was as exquisitely refined as if all her life
had been passed at court.</p>

<p>Having established her guests to her entire satisfaction,
she began to make a bargain with Lady Quaintree for a
more extended stay than that contemplated. She protested
against their running away after a few hours, for
Lady Quaintree had settled that by the afternoon of the
next day she and Lois should drive to Flore Hall, and,
if it were at all inhabitable, stay there perhaps a day, or
a couple of days.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dormer listened with lively interest to the romantic
story of Miss Turquand’s newly acquired riches,
while Blanche coaxed the young girl into the garden for
a quiet talk.</p>

<p>In an hour the girls had cemented a friendship that was
to last till death should them part.</p>

<p>“I know Flore Hall quite well,” said Blanche, when
her enthusiasm had slightly subsided. “A dear, delicious,
old-fashioned place, in what my old nurse calls ‘apple-pie
order.’ You ought to fall in love with the house, the
gardens, the plantations, the shrubberies, the conservatories,
and all the rest, at first sight.”</p>

<p>Blanche went on to give a minute description of the various
beauties of the Hall and its surroundings, until she
made Lois feel more desirous than she had yet been
to see her new possession.</p>

<p>The next day, having been introduced to Squire Dormer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
and shown the house and grounds by Blanche, who
did the honors, Lois, now full of an eager interest, and
Lady Quaintree, quite girllike in her gleeful anticipation,
went to Flore Hall.</p>

<p>There were many discussions as to how they should
go, but it had been finally decided that Miss Dormer
should drive them over in her pony-carriage.</p>

<p>The lanes, the meadows, the sloping uplands, speckled
and dotted with sheep and kine, an occasional gleam of
sunshiny water half-hidden by alders, clumps of willows,
and long grasses, the sweet sounds of country life, the
passing jingle of the bells on a wagoner’s horses, made
the way a veritable Arcadia of summer beauty. A joyous
exhilaration filled Lois’ whole being, and she drank in
the fresh, free air as if it had been the nectar of the gods.</p>

<p>A tolerably smart drive of about an hour’s duration
brought the visitors—for such they considered themselves—to
the massive iron gates of the park surrounding
Flore Hall.</p>

<p>Miss Dormer drew up her cream-colored ponies, to
let the two ladies obtain a general view of the outward
walls and plantations, the pretty lodge, and the surrounding
landscape.</p>

<p>As Lois gazed upon the scene, she for the first time realized
the dazzling change that had taken place in her position.
Her varying color betrayed the emotions of her
heart; but her companions were too much preoccupied
with their inspection to have any attention to spare.</p>

<p>Blanche Dormer knew the place well, but she now regarded
with different eyes the familiar spot.</p>

<p>Nothing whatever could be seen of the house from the
gates, for the walls were very high, and the trees grew
so close together that they formed an apparently impenetrable
screen.</p>

<p>A profound, peaceful silence reigned over the place, and
but for the thin stream of smoke rising from the lodge
chimney, it might have been conceivable that this was
like one of those palaces familiar in the old fairy legends,
where invisible spirits wait, and a spell lies over all.</p>

<p>The mounted servant who attended the ladies alighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
and rang the bell. The clang reverberated, and but a very
few minutes elapsed before the summons was answered.</p>

<p>An exceedingly pleasant-looking young rustic girl came
trippingly along the neatly kept path from the lodge to
the gates, and opening a small postern door at the side,
stood, like some pretty rural figure in a quaintly designed
frame, gazing in mingled astonishment and admiration at
the visitors.</p>

<p>In a moment or two a smile of recognition passed over
her face as she saw Miss Dormer, and she curtsied, awaiting
some explanation of the pleasure of the ladies.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree had ascertained the name of the housekeeper,
and asked if she were in the house.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady,” the girl said.</p>

<p>“We wish to see her,” Miss Dormer said.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss,” the girl again said, curtsying with rustic
civility at almost every monosyllable.</p>

<p>“Open the gates, and let the ladies drive up to the
house,” the groom said. “Is your grandfather at home?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the girl answered; but she unfastened the great
iron gates herself, and let them swing back.</p>

<p>Then she closed them, when the ponies had scampered
through, and as the ladies passed up the carriage-drive
she ran back to the lodge, to inform her deaf old grandfather
that some visitors had arrived.</p>

<p>“Upon my word,” said Lady Quaintree, as they came
in sight of the stately old pile, “you are an exceedingly
lucky girl, my Lois.”</p>

<p>Lois smiled dreamily. No fear, no foreboding, no distrust
disturbed the soft serenity of that moment.</p>

<p>She looked up at the house, and scanned its ivy-grown
walls, its noble turrets, and quaint old windows, its
carved terraces, the profusion of radiant flowers and
stately shrubs and grand old trees, the statues that
gleamed here and there from their leafy, embowering
shades, the fountain that flung up its glittering waters
in the summer sunshine; and while she mentally agreed
with her friend and patroness, she felt that this must be
some glowing, fantastical dream.</p>

<p class="center">GILARDONI’S LOVE-GIFT.</p>


<p>Flore Hall was naturally a quiet, silent place, for it had
rarely been favored by the presence of its owners since
the days when it had passed from the hands of Squire
Rashleigh, whose extravagant habits had ended in his
losing a pretty, well-cultivated estate that had been in
the family since the reign of King Henry II.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Vere Gardiner would have settled tranquilly
down into the calm beatitude of a country gentleman’s
existence, had he succeeded in obtaining the long-yearned-for
desire of his heart—had his one only love
consented to become his wife.</p>

<p>As a bachelor, however, he preferred the busy, changeful
round of a city or town life to the stately solitude of
the grand retreat he had purchased.</p>

<p>The household was left almost exclusively under the
supervision of a very capable personage—Mrs. Ormsby.
This was the housekeeper whom Mr. Gardiner had found
in possession when he acquired the property, and he did
not think of displacing her.</p>

<p>For a short time this excellent widow had dreamed of
capturing the rich owner of Flore Hall and its desirable
belongings. She was a fine woman and clever in her
way, and at first thought the wealthy yet plain Vere
Gardiner would fall an easy victim. But, after a while,
she was obliged to relinquish her ambitious hopes, for
hardly any opportunity was offered of even meeting with
the master of the stately abode where she held vice-regal
sway. Then she was fain to turn her attention to the
steward—a wiry, cool-headed old bachelor, who saw her
innocent little arts clearly enough, and amused himself
by laughing in his sleeve at the sly, good-looking widow.</p>

<p>Due notice had been given to the housekeeper, steward,
and servants of the change of dynasty. At present,
Mrs. Ormsby knew just the name of her future mistress—no
more, not even her age or social standing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ormsby anticipated a very grand scene indeed
when Miss Turquand should pay her first visit to the
Hall. She hardly knew whether to feel indifferent or
disgusted by the impending alterations, but wisely determined
to wait the course of events. No one could tell
her anything whatever of Miss Turquand. In her imagination,
the new proprietress seemed to be a starched old
maid, who might perhaps “come and settle here, and
worry my life out,” the widow fancied. Of a charming
young girl of eighteen, she never for an instant dreamed.</p>

<p>When one of the few servants forming the necessarily
limited household came to inform her that three ladies
wished to see her, she supposed they were strangers, who
desired permission to view the house.</p>

<p>She threw down her plain sewing, and quitted the
morning-room in which she was sitting—a delightful
nook, half in sun, half in shade, affording a view of the
prettiest part of the garden and of the extensive landscape
beyond.</p>

<p>In her rich black silk and violet ribbons, she rustled
along a glass-covered way leading into the great square
hall—this a curious and fine example of quaint architecture.</p>

<p>The ladies were at the principal door, in the pony-carriage
waiting for her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ormsby had never seen Blanche Dormer, so that
the three aristocratic-looking ladies were all equally
strangers to her. She glanced from one to the other,
her eyes finally resting on Lady Quaintree.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ormsby, I believe?” said her ladyship.</p>

<p>The housekeeper curtsied affirmatively.</p>

<p>Her ladyship proceeded to explain the reason for this
visit, and directed Mrs. Ormsby’s attention to the youthful
owner of the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ormsby gazed at Lois with mingled curiosity and
surprise. Without betraying any visible emotion, however,
she begged the ladies to alight and enter.</p>

<p>As the late Mr. Vere Gardiner had every now and then
paid a totally unexpected visit to the Hall, and gave instructions
that it was to be constantly kept in perfect order,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
within and without, the house and grounds were
always ready for the closest inspection.</p>

<p>The housekeeper preceded the ladies into the great
oak-carved hall, and threw open a door to the right.</p>

<p>“Miss Turquand had some idea of staying here for
to-night, if not for a couple of days,” said Lady Quaintree,
gazing around through her gold-rimmed glasses.
“Would you be able to accommodate us?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my lady. You would wish to dine here?”</p>

<p>“If it could be managed—yes,” said Lady Quaintree.</p>

<p>“I had better order your carriage round to the stables,
then, my lady.”</p>

<p>“My dearest Blanche, you will surely stay till morning?”
said Lady Quaintree, who seemed far more the
mistress than Lois, who had wandered to one of the long,
wide windows, and was regarding the highly cultivated
garden with pleasure and interest.</p>

<p>“Mama would be alarmed——”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! I will send word by Stephen, your groom,
that your mama is not to expect her dear Blanchette till
she sees her. Come, that is settled.”</p>

<p>To Blanche, who loved adventure and novelty, while
her daily existence bordered almost on monotony, the
little escapade proposed was by no means unacceptable.</p>

<p>With the vivid fancy of a lively young girl, she already
looked forward to a not very far-distant period,
when gay revels under the auspices of her new friend
should wake this fair solitude.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ormsby rang the bell, and presently the ponies
were seen trotting by the windows on the side next the
entrance.</p>

<p>After a short rest, during which Lady Quaintree gave
such information to the housekeeper as she deemed advisable,
it was settled that they should be shown over
the house.</p>

<p>Then came dinner, most excellently planned and arranged
by Mrs. Ormsby, and after that a walk and a
drive to see the gardens and plantations.</p>

<p>As yet, it did not seem real to Lois. Lady Quaintree
and her new friend Blanche continually asked her what
she thought of this pretty place; but her replies were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
very brief. The dreamy smile on her lips, however, and
within the clear depths of her eyes, answered eloquently
enough.</p>

<p>Every hour Lady Quaintree coveted this girl more as
a wife for her son. This retired spot had quite taken her
fancy by storm, and she thought resentfully of the man
who had been selected as future owner of the Hall and
its mistress.</p>

<p>Her ladyship might have dismissed the faintest spark
of hope. It would have been absolutely impossible for
Lois ever to have cared in the slightest degree for the
Honorable Gerald. She had not forgotten for one moment
the handsome face, the soft, half-melancholy eyes,
that had startled her on entering Lady Quaintree’s salon
on that now memorable evening of her life.</p>

<p>Perhaps, had Paul Desfrayne carefully planned the
best course to arouse a tender, half-piqued interest in
the breast of this girl, he could scarcely have devised one
different from the one he was now following.</p>

<p>The more resolutely Lois tried to drive away the recollection
of her mysterious trustee, the more his image
seemed to present itself obstinately before her. She found
herself speculating on the reasons he might have for
avoiding her, and behaving in so rude and cold a manner
when obliged to address her.</p>

<p>Only twice had she seen him, and already she was
annoyed by finding herself wondering frequently where
and when she should see him again. To her girlish
mind the explanation of his coldness was easy enough.</p>

<p>“He loves another, and is probably annoyed as much
as I can be by the painfully embarrassing bargain made
between us by the kind old man who has been the benefactor
of us both,” she thought.</p>

<p>It did not occur to her that perhaps Captain Desfrayne,
while not base enough to seek to win the splendid
fortune in view by marrying one girl when he loved
another, might yet desire to save the part promised to
him by driving her to refuse to fulfil the contract. She
might have remembered that he was to receive fifty
thousand pounds if the refusal emanated from her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
only ten if he were the one to decline acceding to the
wishes of the dead old man.</p>

<p>Lois Turquand, however, was as little worldly wise as
Paul Desfrayne, and her nature inclined toward romance
and sentiment.</p>

<p>As mistress of the house, she was consigned by Mrs.
Ormsby to a dreadfully grand, well-nigh somber state
bedroom, while Lady Quaintree and Blanche were conducted
to a large, cheerful apartment, her ladyship wishing
to have her pretty country friend with her.</p>

<p>Lois stood gazing around the chamber for some time
after she was left alone. Then she regarded the beautiful
gardens beneath, lying bathed in a silvery flood of
summer moonlight.</p>

<p>All seemed so tranquil, so calm, so sweet, Lois felt as
if she could be satisfied to let her life flow onward in
this sylvan retreat without desiring a change.</p>

<p>The morning came—the morning of the day when the
soldiers in occupancy of the barracks at Holston were to
give place to others.</p>

<p>Lois and Blanche went out early into the grounds.
The appearance of the beautiful young owner, in so sudden
and mysterious a way, had created a profound sensation
among the servants, but, although many a pair of
curious eyes darted inquisitive glances from sheltered
corners, not a soul was visible.</p>

<p>The bright, pleasant, laughing voices of the girls were
answered or echoed by the wild, soft warblings of innumerable
birds.</p>

<p>Blanche was more full of delight and admiration than
even on the previous day. She led Lois down to a secluded
path, which went slopingly to a wide sheet of
water, dancing and gleaming as if crested with ten thousand
diamonds.</p>

<p>“There is a boat somewhere about here,” said Blanche
Dormer. “I remember when we came here one day for
a picnic some few years ago, we went on the water, and
crossed over to that pavilion yonder. Do you see it?—there,
by the water’s edge, yonder, nearly hidden by trees
and climbing plants.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>Lois looked across, and saw the fairylike summer-house.</p>

<p>“It was an odd fancy to build it so that you could not
reach it without crossing the water,” Blanche went on.
“I am an excellent oar, and I should like to cross this
afternoon, while we leave Lady Quaintree to her siesta.”</p>

<p>The girls returned to breakfast in the gayest of spirits.
At that hour Paul Desfrayne was being whirled down
from London.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Gilardoni, who had attended his new
master, remarked how pale and weary he looked.</p>

<p>Since the evening Gilardoni had entered Captain Desfrayne’s
service, and that very brief dialogue concerning
Lucia Guiscardini had passed, the name of the famous
Italian singer had never been mentioned by either.
Neither knew that the life of the other had been blighted
by this lovely snake in woman’s form.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne seemed too languid to make any effort
to rouse himself this day.</p>

<p>Gilardoni, who appeared to have already formed a
strong attachment to the kindly man who had held out
his hand in the hour of bitter need—Gilardoni watched
him with a strange sort of yearning pity and sympathy.</p>

<p>“This is no mere physical fatigue,” the Italian said to
himself. “Nor does it look like threatening illness.
There is some mental strain.”</p>

<p>He at length approached his master, deferentially, yet
with the air of one who intends to be heard.</p>

<p>“I am sure, sir, it would do you a world of good if
you were to ride out for an hour or two,” he said.</p>

<p>“Thanks for your attention, Gilardoni, but I feel too
weary.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir, I believe if you were to have a breath
of fresh air, it would make all the difference,” Gilardoni
urged. “A canter along some of those leafy roads and
lanes we saw as we passed in the train would clear the
clouds off your brain. Forgive me if I make too free, but
I think——”</p>

<p>“What do you think?” demanded his master, a little
sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“Well, sir—I hope you won’t be displeased—I think
you are weary in mind, not in body.”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne looked keenly at his servant for a
moment or two, then the expression that had almost attained
a frown melted into a sad smile.</p>

<p>“You are not far wrong, Gilardoni,” he said, very
quietly. “I have been very much troubled of late by—by
business affairs.”</p>

<p>“I trust, sir, you will not consider me intrusive.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, my good fellow. I think I ought to
feel indebted to you for your kindly interest. I will take
your advice, and go for a canter before mess.”</p>

<p>His horse was soon waiting for him—the animal being
one of the few luxuries Captain Desfrayne permitted
himself out of his limited income.</p>

<p>The Italian attended him to the gates of the barracks,
and then stood gazing after him with the kind of interest
and affection so often seen in the eyes of a faithful, attached
Newfoundland dog.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with him?” he thought. “Money-troubles,
most likely. He doesn’t seem the kind of man
to be crossed in love—unless the girl he wanted liked
somebody else before she saw him. Perhaps that has
happened. I hope he will come back a little more cheerful.”</p>

<p>Gilardoni turned to go back to his master’s rooms.
As he moved, a small, folded package lying a few steps
from him caught his quick eye. He stooped and picked
it up.</p>

<p>Before opening it, as there was nothing on the outside
of the thin tissue-paper to indicate who the owner
might be, he felt it over with his fingers.</p>

<p>“Feels like a small cross,” he said to himself. “I wonder
if the captain dropped it when he pulled out his handkerchief
just now.”</p>

<p>He unfolded the paper, and displayed to view a small
gold cross, such as are worn as a pendant on the watch-chain.</p>

<p>Gilardoni regarded this with an air of the most unqualified
amazement, mingled with an expression that
seemed to indicate rage and contending sensations of no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
very agreeable kind. For several moments he remained
as if carved in stone, fixedly looking upon the trinket.
It was a comparatively inexpensive toy, made of burnished
gold, set with blue stones on one side, perfectly
plain on the other.</p>

<p>“It is impossible,” Gilardoni murmured, at length, raising
his eyes, which wore a singularly startled expression.
“Oh! it cannot be the same. Why, they make these
things by the hundred. How could it be possible that it
could come into the possession of Captain Desfrayne?
Yet—yet it <i>must</i> be my fatal love-gift.”</p>

<p>He abruptly turned the cross, and looked at the nethermost
point. Thereon was very inartistically cut or engraved
a tiny heart pierced by an arrow.</p>

<p>“<i>Cielo!</i>” he cried, starting back. “It <i>is</i> the same.
Then has it been dropped by the captain, or how has it
come here? Am I dreaming? Am I going mad?”</p>

<p>He turned slowly, and walked toward the barracks,
his head sunk upon his breast, as if he were overwhelmed
by painful reflections and memories.</p>

<p>“The moment the captain returns, I shall ask him if
this was in his possession, and how he came by it. Perhaps
Lucia sold or lost it, and it fell into the hands of
some dealer, from whom he may have bought it. Yes,
that must be so.”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne would probably not return for a
couple of hours. Gilardoni must wait with what patience
he could muster. By dint of arguing with himself, he
at length almost arrived at the conclusion that during
his tour in Italy the captain had purchased the gold
cross.</p>

<p>That Captain Desfrayne had ever been acquainted with
Lucia Guiscardini, he did not for a moment dream.</p>

<p>If the thought came into his mind that the cross had
been a gift from <i>la</i> Lucia to the young Englishman, he
dismissed it as utterly improbable.</p>

<p>The sudden finding of the trinket that bore so many
mingled recollections with it had made him feel faint and
sick from emotion, and as the slow minutes wore away
he grew paler and paler.</p>

<p>“She wears diamonds now that emperors scarce could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
buy,” he said to himself, contemplating that tiny love-gift,
“yet I doubt if any of the gems that cluster in her
jewel-boxes have given her half the rapture of vanity and
pleasure that thrilled her false heart when I clasped this
little gewgaw about her neck. She pretended she loved
me, and returned my kiss—and I had the folly to believe
her true. Folly, folly, folly! Some day I may have her
at my feet, and then—aye, then——”</p>

<p>He clenched his hand with frenzied rage.</p>

<p>And all the time Paul Desfrayne was riding, he scarce
cared whither, under the soft, genial sunshine, that made
the landscape seem a fairy-land—riding onward, the
sport of fate, to rivet yet another link in the chain of his
strange, fevered life.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">IN THE THUNDER-STORM.</p>


<p>In the afternoon, fortune, deceitful, false friend that
she is, favored Blanche Dormer’s caprice for rowing
across the lake to the pretty pavilion on the other side.</p>

<p>Her mother, Mrs. Dormer, took a fancy for driving
over to see Flore Hall, and came about four or five
o’clock.</p>

<p>Having been escorted over the house, she was too fatigued
to go into the grounds, and, as Lady Quaintree
was not sorry for an excuse to rest, the two matrons subsided
into a pleasant, gossiping chat in what was called
the blue drawing-room, with a diminutive table between
them, whereon was set a rare tea-service of Sèvres china.</p>

<p>The girls readily obtained leave of absence. Blanche
did not announce her intention of going on the water,
however, for she was afraid of being forbidden to do so.</p>

<p>“It seems so droll to think of a girl like you being
sole proprietress of this big house and all this ground,”
Blanche laughingly said, as they tripped down from the
terrace into the garden. “Mama said there would be a
storm, but I don’t believe there will be a drop of rain.”</p>

<p>A far-distant peal of thunder reverberated as she spoke,
but it seemed too far off to mean danger.</p>

<p>Blanche again proposed crossing to the summer-house
on the other side.</p>

<p>“I am a splendid oar,” she said, smiling, “so you need
not be afraid to trust yourself to my care.”</p>

<p>Lois hesitated for a few moments, but the proposition
was too tempting to be resisted.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more they were floating pleasantly
over the mirrored surface of the waters. It was so calm,
so dreamlike thus half-drifting across, that both girls
wished they were going an indefinite distance.</p>

<p>In half a dozen minutes they were landed at the foot of
the flight of steps leading up to the summer pavilion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>It was so quiet in this secluded spot that, to any one
totally alone, the stillness would have been oppressive.
Not a breath ruffled the leaves, not a solitary bird’s twitter
broke the silence.</p>

<p>The pavilion was situated in the central part of a great
clump of trees, nestling amid its rich, encircling foliage
like an indolent beauty lying among velvet cushions.</p>

<p>Partly oppressed by the dreamlike silence, and the
sultriness of the day, the young girls ascended and seated
themselves, Blanche on the first step, Lois on one of the
fragile wicker chairs.</p>

<p>They forgot to secure their tiny bark, nor did they observe
that after a while it began to drift beyond their
reach.</p>

<p>Neither seemed inclined to break the silence that was
partly soothing, partly oppressive. When two people
have only recently been introduced, even if mutually desirous
of extending their knowledge of one another, it is
rather difficult to start an interesting train of conversation
when the trivialities of the moment have been exhausted.</p>

<p>Blanche Dormer, however, was never very long at a
loss. She was soon in the midst of a rattling talk such as
she enjoyed.</p>

<p>“Have you ever been in this part of the world before?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“You have no friends in the neighborhood?”</p>

<p>“None whatever. I have very few friends anywhere.”</p>

<p>“You will have plenty soon,” Miss Dormer philosophically
remarked. “I understand you were Lady Quaintree’s
companion?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I have been with her since I was fourteen.”</p>

<p>“Are you a relative?”</p>

<p>“Oh! dear no. My mother was—was born in quite
a different station. She was an embroideress. But she
died, and Lady Quaintree was good enough to take an
interest in me, and become my protectress.”</p>

<p>“How kind! She is a dear, good soul. And so now
you are a great heiress. You had some rich relations,
then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t think I had a relative in the world except
my dear mother,” said Lois, a little sadly.</p>

<p>Blanche Dormer opened her eyes. Miss Dormer was
related to half the wealthy commons of England.</p>

<p>“No relations!” she exclaimed, forgetting that she
was guilty of an outrageous breach of good manners in
thus expressing surprise. “How very strange! I
thought you had inherited this place and sacks of money
from your uncle.”</p>

<p>Lois shook her head.</p>

<p>“I had no uncles that I am aware of. My father died
when I was a baby, and I never heard my mother speak
of his relatives. She herself was an only child.”</p>

<p>“Then why——”</p>

<p>Miss Dormer stopped abruptly, and blushed a little.
Lois laughed as she noticed the hesitation.</p>

<p>“Why did Mr. Gardiner make me a person of property?”
she supplied. “I cannot tell you, for, although I
read his will, I have not seen the slightest hint of his reasons
for being so generous. To tell you the truth, I have
been puzzling over it ever since.”</p>

<p>“What a romantic mystery! Are you sure he was not
related to you, my dear?”</p>

<p>“If he had been, they would certainly have told me
so.”</p>

<p>“Did anybody offer you any explanation of his reasons
for leaving you his property?” asked Blanche, whose curiosity
was strongly excited on the subject.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Did you ask? Forgive me. I am afraid you will
think I am taking unwarrantable liberties in thus cross-questioning
you,” apologized Miss Dormer.</p>

<p>“No, I do not think so in the least. I feel happy to
think you will be my friend,” replied Lois softly. “I did
not ask any questions about Mr. Gardiner’s will, because——”</p>

<p>She suddenly remembered why she had felt tongue-tied,
and her face became suffused with crimson. Blanche,
who was steadily regarding her, was much surprised by
this evidence of emotion; but, although her curiosity was
still further aroused, she had sufficient delicacy to restrain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
herself, and adroitly to change the subject of conversation.</p>

<p>She began to speak about the departure of troops from
the barracks, which were situated a couple of miles from
the vicinity of her father’s house. This gave Lois an
opportunity of recovering her composure, for which she
felt grateful, although if Blanche had pressed her much
further she would have confided to her the embarrassing
circumstances to which Mr. Vere Gardiner’s will was
likely to lead.</p>

<p>As Miss Dormer chatted gaily, heavy splashes of
rain came suddenly pattering through the clustering
leaves, and a vivid flash of lightning, followed almost instantaneously
by a crashing peal of thunder, startled the
girls, and made them hurriedly retreat into the pretty pavilion.</p>

<p>The day had changed as if by magic. The sky was
overcast with driving clouds like squadrons of artillery,
the sun had disappeared, the whole aspect of the bright
garden and the smiling lake had altered as if by the wave
of the wand of some malicious fairy.</p>

<p>A summer storm had burst over the heads of these
timid girls, and they looked at each other in dismay. It
was a situation likely to become extremely unpleasant.
No one knew that they were here. Even if their screams
could be heard, it would be difficult for any one to reach
the place, as the tiny wherry was drifting about, out of
reach.</p>

<p>The waters of the lake began to foam and lash with
frenzy. Every instant the storm increased in fury. The
girls clung to one another in affright, unable to help
shrieking when a blue-forked flame encircled them, or
a prolonged roar, as of besieging artillery, seemed to rend
the heavens asunder.</p>

<p>Each moment it seemed as if they must be slain in that
fervent embrace.</p>

<p>A flash of lightning, more piercing than any that
had preceded it, swept in a jagged curve over the pavilion,
and a peal of thunder shook the fragile building
to its foundations. Terrified almost beyond expression,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
Lois clung more closely to Blanche, and then fell back
into her arms in a dead swoon.</p>

<p>Before Blanche could collect her thoughts, herself terror-stricken
almost to the verge of insanity, a panel,
which had looked as if merely a portion of the highly
finished decorations of the airy walls, slid back, and a
gentleman suddenly faced the young girl, as she placed
Lois in a chair.</p>

<p>This gentleman was Paul Desfrayne.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to say which felt or mutely expressed
the most surprise, Miss Dormer or the stranger.
They gazed at one another in amazement for a moment
or two, and then the young man, lifting his cap with
mechanical politeness, advanced.</p>

<p>By his military undress uniform, Blanche judged him
to be one of the newly arrived officers, but how he had
appeared as if from the solid walls, she could not conceive.</p>

<p>From the position of Miss Dormer, who stood partly
in front of Lois, Captain Desfrayne could not see the
fainting girl’s face, but his heart sorely misgave him as
to her identity.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said, looking at Blanche with surprise
and compassion, “how is it that I find you in such a perilous
position?”</p>

<p>Blanche, in a few words, explained. Then she turned
again to her friend, and, kneeling before her, tried by
every device to restore her to consciousness.</p>

<p>“Good heavens, Miss Turquand!” murmured Captain
Desfrayne, under his breath.</p>

<p>Faint as his tones were, however, they caught the quick
ear of Blanche Dormer.</p>

<p>“You know her, sir?” she exclaimed, looking up in
his face.</p>

<p>“I can scarcely claim that privilege,” he replied, with
icy coldness.</p>

<p>He stepped quickly to the door, plucked a large, strong
leaf from the overhanging branches, which he twisted into
a cup, and, filling it with water by descending the steps
and dipping it in the lake, returned, and gave it to
Blanche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>Then he stood by, gazing with an uncontrollable interest
upon the white, delicately chiseled face of the unconscious
Lois.</p>

<p>“She has been alarmed by the storm?” he said presently,
as Lois began to show symptoms of returning life.
“You must not remain here.”</p>

<p>“How can we escape?” demanded Blanche.</p>

<p>“By the way I came. It leads by a succession of corridors
to a ruined abbey, from whence again you can
reach the Hall by passing through a labyrinth of secret
vaults and passages.”</p>

<p>Blanche turned pale. Even this place, insecure as the
shelter was, did not appear so alarming as the way of
escape indicated.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne smiled—that half-melancholy, winning
smile that had such a charm of its own.</p>

<p>“It sounds rather terrifying,” he said gently. “But as
I see you have let your boat drift away, you cannot reach
the house by way of the lake. Even if you had your boat,
the waters are too dangerous to be trusted, and this storm
may not abate for a couple of hours. Do not be afraid.
I know every turn well, for I used to come here constantly
when a boy. There is no other road to the house.
I presume you have come from the Hall?” he abruptly
asked. “I was informed that Miss Turquand had come
to stay for a few days there, and so I supposed——”</p>

<p>“We rowed across the lake only about half an hour
ago, and then the sky looked as clear as—as if it were
never going to rain any more,” Blanche explained.</p>

<p>“You have no wraps of any kind?” he added, glancing
with an odd sort of half-paternal compassion at the silken
draperies of Lois, and the cloudy azure-blue and white
skirts of her beautiful friend.</p>

<p>Before Miss Dormer could reply, if reply were needed—for
nothing in the shape of protection against bad
weather, except one large sunshade, was visible—Lois
opened her eyes.</p>

<p>The young officer drew back slightly, but he was the
first object upon which her gaze rested.</p>

<p>She roused herself, and sat up.</p>

<p>“Are you better, dearest?” anxiously asked Blanche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>Lois did not answer, but tried to rise from her chair.
She looked at the young man who was regarding her with
so much profound interest, and a rosy blush overspread
her face.</p>

<p>“Captain Desfrayne!” she murmured.</p>

<p>He advanced one step, then paused.</p>

<p>“You are probably surprised to see me here, Miss
Turquand,” he said. “Perhaps not more surprised than
I am to find myself within these walls, or to discover you
here. I came out for a ride, and scarcely noticed which
road my horse took, until I was overtaken by the storm.
But you must not remain here. The sooner you quit this
place the better. The storm shows no signs of abating.
Will you permit me to be your guide? Are you strong
enough to walk, Miss Turquand?”</p>

<p>Blanche put her arms about Lois to support her. Lois
moved forward a few steps; but the agitation, however
pleasant, of the last few days, the nervous trepidation
caused by the storm, acting on a singularly susceptible
temperament, and the weakness induced by her fainting-fit,
proved too much for her to contend against, and she
swayed again, sinking into the arms of Blanche, who
caught her.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne’s lips compressed very firmly as he
looked at the young girl thus lying helpless. For a moment
he reflected.</p>

<p>“I must not be a coward,” he argued with himself.
“What folly! It cannot signify to me. The sooner we
are out of this situation the better.”</p>

<p>Then he addressed Blanche with a calm, self-possessed
manner, strangely at variance with his real feelings.</p>

<p>“You must allow me to be more than your guide.
There is serious danger in your remaining here. May I
carry your friend?”</p>

<p>There was no choice but to comply. He took Lois
from the arms of her companion, and lifted her in his
own strong, firm clasp. He glanced down at the pale,
statuesque face as it rested against his shoulder, but it
was impossible to even guess at his thoughts from the expression
upon his countenance, which was that of perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
impassibility, though a certain eager interest lurked in
his eyes.</p>

<p>Through the door by which he had so unexpectedly
entered, down a long, apparently interminable flight of
somewhat steep steps, along one dim corridor after another,
until Blanche began to feel bewildered, and to imagine
herself in a dream.</p>

<p>She did not attempt to address a solitary remark to the
friend who had so suddenly come like a knight of old to
the rescue of distressed damsels, but followed him with
implicit faith as he strode with a quick step onward.</p>

<p>Once he turned his head and spoke, as if he guessed
she must feel mystified, or to break the current of his own
unpleasant thoughts.</p>

<p>“These passages are very confusing to any one not
thoroughly acquainted with the various turnings. I believe
their origin is unknown, though the tradition still
exists of many a strange legend of how cavaliers escaped
their pursuers this way, and fled to the friendly sea.”</p>

<p>Nothing more was said, and the strange procession
moved on until the fresh air blew in, and the dash of the
sullen rain, the soughing of the trees, told that they were
near the entrance.</p>

<p>Left without guidance, Blanche could not have formed
the most distant idea of where she was, or which way
to take. She could see nothing but a wide expanse of
rain-blotted gray-green, looking at this moment the picture
of desolation.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne did not emerge upon the wild, stormy
scene without, however. He pushed open a door apparently
hewn from solid stone, and entered a small, dimly
lighted chapel. It was a circular building, half in ruins,
though the beautiful stained-glass windows were almost
intact.</p>

<p>With the most tender care, Paul Desfrayne placed his
inanimate charge upon one of the carved oaken seats,
and then stood by, watching her.</p>

<p>A half-sobbing sigh told that the young girl was reviving,
and she turned wildly, to seek for Blanche.</p>

<p>“You are safe now, if in some discomfort,” said Captain
Desfrayne, in a reassuring tone, though he partially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
averted his gaze. “Will you remain here until I summon
assistance? Are you afraid to stay unprotected? There
is not the slightest fear of any intrusion. If any living
being come within these walls, it will be only some country
lout seeking shelter from the storm.”</p>

<p>“Where are we?” asked Lois, looking about her as if
still half-dazed.</p>

<p>“Within the walls of an old ruined abbey about three-quarters
of a mile from—from Flore Hall.” He pronounced
the name of the place with some difficulty, as if
it were distasteful to him.</p>

<p>“But you will be obliged to go through the rain,” objected
Blanche, who was pleased by the handsome face
and chivalrous bearing of the captain.</p>

<p>“No. If necessary, I should not hesitate to do so. My
horse is waiting for me under shelter in a ruined stable
close by, and I could soon ride the distance. But my desire
to aid you will not be put to any trial. There are
rude, covered, subterranean passages from this spot to the
Hall, and I can easily traverse them, for I know every
inch of the ground.”</p>

<p>“What thanks do we not owe you, sir!” exclaimed
Miss Dormer.</p>

<p>Lois remained silent, her eyes bent on the ground, her
color varying with each wave of thought that passed
through her brain.</p>

<p>Partly rejoiced at his temporary release, partly dubious
of the propriety of quitting these timid girls, Captain
Desfrayne turned to go on his errand.</p>

<p>As he did so, a shuffling noise startled the three. They
turned simultaneously, in alarm, and saw a big, shock-headed
country boy, apparently shaking himself awake,
rising from a seat veiled in such dim obscurity that none
of the little group had noticed the recumbent figure.</p>

<p>The boy had taken refuge from the raging tempest
here, and had after a while dropped off asleep. Half-awakened
by the voices, he had dimly heard the conversation.</p>

<p>“Please, zur,” he said, lugging at some stray locks of
red hair lying on his freckled forehead, “do’ee want onybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
to run a message to thay Hall, zur? ’Cause, if so
be ’ee do, I be main glad to do it for your honor, zur.”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne looked at him in mingled doubt and
displeasure. He reflected for a moment or two, then
said:</p>

<p>“How would you get to the Hall, boy?”</p>

<p>“Why, zur, along thay dark places with thay pillars.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you know the way, my lad?”</p>

<p>“Zartain zure, zur. Whoy, often’s been the time when
me, and Bill Heath, and Joe Tollard, and all thay rest o’
’em hev played hoide and zeek in ’em. Oh! I knows thay
way, zure enough.”</p>

<p>It would not be possible to refuse to allow this eager
substitute to go on the pressing errand he had himself
contemplated. Paul Desfrayne was compelled to let
him go.</p>

<p>“Well, make haste, and bring somebody to take care
of these young ladies,” he said. “What is your name—Robin
Roughhead?”</p>

<p>“No, zur—George Netherclift.”</p>

<p>“Well, Master George Netherclift, if ever you made
haste in your life, do so now.”</p>

<p>The boy—a great lumping lad of fourteen or fifteen,
with a stolid, good-humored, red-yellow face, and a thick-set
figure, clad in a smock frock and a pair of tough
corduroy trousers—started on with more nimbleness than
any one would have given him credit for. In the silence,
his clattering, hob-nailed boots raised countless echoes in
the rude, vaulted passages as he trotted along.</p>

<p>An uncomfortable embarrassment succeeded his departure.
Lois felt ashamed of her weakness, and abashed
in the presence of the tall, handsome captain, unable to
forget the secret link that in a measure bound their lives
together. Paul Desfrayne almost cursed the destiny that
had thus dragged him within those dangerous precincts
he would fain shun. Blanche Dormer caught the infection
from these two, who were acquainted with each
other, yet seemed to make some mystery of the matter,
and so she remained silent.</p>

<p>Lois dared not lift her eyes from the ground. Paul
Desfrayne stood at some distance, viewing the rain as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
it plashed down, and regarding the now more rarely recurring
flashes of lightning with an absent air, as if his
real thoughts were far away.</p>

<p>On setting out for his ride, he had permitted his horse
to take any road that presented itself, seeing that the way
led far from the neighborhood of Flore Hall. After a
while he had almost dropped the reins on the animal’s
neck, and allowed his mind to revert to the painful subject
of his most unhappy position—a subject but seldom
out of his memory. He had ridden slowly for a long
distance from the barracks when the first pattering drops
of rain came splashing down. Seeing that the sky was
overcast by dense black clouds, and hearing the distant
rumbling of the thunder, he had looked about for some
convenient shelter, and then, to his great surprise, found
himself close by the ruined abbey he so well remembered.</p>

<p>Dismounting, he had secured his horse in an old ruined
stable, and then entered the familiar place, his feelings
not all pain, yet not all pleasure. That any one should
have ventured to the summer pavilion he did not for a
moment imagine. Wishing to see as much of the spot as
possible while he could do so in safety, he had rapidly
traversed the dim corridors, and, opening the door in the
paneling of the wall, had come upon the two young girls.</p>

<p>For the first time now he recollected that he had left
his faithful Greyburn alone for some time, and feared
that perhaps the poor animal might have been frightened
by the fury of the tempest.</p>

<p>“I trust you will not be alarmed if I leave you for a
few moments to look after my horse. I left him, as I
think I told you, in a ruined stable close at hand; but I
should be glad to know how he fares,” said Captain Desfrayne,
as the echoes of George Netherclift’s heavy steps
died away.</p>

<p>“Oh! pray see him,” cried both girls.</p>

<p>“I shall not be gone for more than a few minutes, and
I shall be within call,” said the young man.</p>

<p>He went out, leaving the two young ladies together.
As he departed, he glanced for an instant at Lois.</p>

<p>The lovely, fathomless eyes were raised to his. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
gazed as if spellbound into the dreamy, liquid depths.
Then, with an indefinable expression of mingled emotion,
he abruptly disappeared behind the angle of the old
Gothic porch.</p>

<p>Lois’ heart seemed to stand still for a second, then began
to beat with such rapidity that she put her hand to
her side to stay its throbbing. Then she looked at
Blanche, who began to think that the mystery was simply
that the two lovers who had quarreled had unexpectedly
met again, and that pride, or the presence of a third—herself—hindered
a reconciliation.</p>

<p>In answer to a question from Miss Turquand, she explained
how they had come hither. A vivid flash dyed the
pale cheeks of Lois when she learned how she had been
conveyed to this unknown locality.</p>

<p>How little had she anticipated a meeting such as this
in wondering where she should see Paul Desfrayne
again! How little had she dreamed of it on Saturday
afternoon, when she had encountered him among the
gaily dressed loungers in the Zoological Gardens!</p>

<p>It seemed as if she had known him half a lifetime now,
from some strange affinity that made his presence, his
voice, his face familiar. And yet one short week ago
she had been ignorant of his very existence.</p>

<p>Frank Amberley, whom she had seen almost daily for
four years—the four years that had brought her from
childhood to fairest maidenhood—was forgotten, save
when actually present, and then regarded as belonging to
the most formal rank of friends. She would never, unless
under pressure of some most extraordinary difficulty,
have thought of consulting him, or seeking his aid in any
way whatever.</p>

<p>Blanche Dormer drew out her tiny jeweled watch.</p>

<p>“What will mama think, do, or say?” she exclaimed.
“It will be enough to drive her crazy. Good heavens!
my dearest Miss Turquand, they will imagine we have
been capsized into the lake when they see the boat drifting
about. When mama’s fright is over, I shall be in
horrible disgrace. Such a thing never happened in all the
nineteen years of my life. Lady Quaintree will be like
a maniac. I shall never forgive myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>Lois felt Miss Dormer was speaking the truth, and
could not think of one solitary iota of consolation.</p>

<p>They sat very silent, waiting for release from their
exceedingly disagreeable and irksome situation.</p>

<p>Blanche was partly right in her conjectures; but fortunately
not so far as her fears pictured. The two ladies,
absorbed in their ancient memories, were so occupied that
they did not observe the coming storm till the first violent
roll of thunder, or rather the advanced flash of blue,
forked lightning, made one jump from her seat with a
scream, and caused the other to drop her dainty Sèvres
cup with a crash on the white bearskin at her feet.</p>

<p>They knew that the girls had gone for a walk in the
grounds; but hoped they had taken warning and returned.
Lady Quaintree had rung with a jerk for her
maid, Justine, to demand if the young ladies had come in.</p>

<p>Justine said she thought they had, and went off to ascertain.
But, unhappily, she had loitered, under pretense
of being frightened by the thunder and lightning, in company
with a tall footman, who professed to be very much
in love with her. Partly by his persuasion to linger,
partly from her own inclination to indulge in a stolen
flirtation, she stayed until minutes stole into an hour,
and she had completely forgotten her errand.</p>

<p>Finding she did not return, Lady Quaintree took it for
granted the young ladies had come in, but perhaps with
drenched garments, and that Justine was staying to help
them in changing their attire.</p>

<p>Fully persuaded that this must be the case, the two
dames resumed their conversation, though in a more subdued
key. They were not nervous or easily frightened
by the electrical influences which had so seriously disturbed
the young girls, and, Lady Quaintree having coolly
drawn the lace curtains across the windows, they sat
quite contentedly. It at length occurred to them as odd
that neither Lois Turquand nor Blanche should present
herself.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree rang again.</p>

<p>“Where is Miss Turquand?—where is Miss Dormer?”
she inquired of the domestic who appeared.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, my lady,” replied the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“Where is my maid?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, my lady.”</p>

<p>“Find her, then, and tell her to request the young ladies
to come here directly.”</p>

<p>Presently the fellow came back, with the alarming
information that neither the young ladies nor Justine
were to be found.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” cried her ladyship, unable to credit
her ears. “Not to be found? Impossible! Nonsense!
They <i>must</i> be found! Why, my maid left me a short
time since to seek for Miss Turquand and Miss Dormer.
Oh! this is absurd!”</p>

<p>The man departed again on a search that proved useless.
He presented himself again, fearfully, to tell her
ladyship so.</p>

<p>The truth about Justine was that, recollecting her message
suddenly, she had flown to Miss Turquand’s room,
and then to all the probable and even improbable places
where the young ladies might be found; but, of course,
without coming on any trace of the missing ones.</p>

<p>Thoroughly alarmed, marveling what had become of
them, and not daring to go back to her mistress, she had
darted wildly all over the house, making inquiries of
everybody she met.</p>

<p>Several of the domestics had seen the young ladies
go out, but no one had seen them return.</p>

<p>Forgetful, in her sore affright, of her nervous tremors
in a storm, Justine had rushed into the grounds, armed
with a big umbrella snatched up in passing through the
entrance-hall. Thus her otherwise unaccountable disappearance
was to be explained.</p>

<p>In a short time the entire household was astir, alarmed
by the discovery that the young ladies were not within
the Hall. If not there, where were they? Of necessity,
they must be out in the grounds, perhaps in the porter’s
lodge.</p>

<p>One servant ran down to the lodge, only to bring back
word that the young ladies had never been there.</p>

<p>Others scattered themselves over the gardens, seeking
in the conservatories and graperies, in the plantations,
in every imaginable place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>It was the gardener who came to the horrifying conclusion
that the girls had ventured on the lake in the
flimsy boat, and had been capsized.</p>

<p>He found Justine wandering near the borders of the
water in a state of distraction. She could not tell that
the boat had been safely moored that morning and in the
early afternoon, but she had paused here.</p>

<p>The gardener imprudently betrayed his suspicion, and
had the satisfaction of seeing Mademoiselle Justine fall
in a heap, in violent hysterics, objurgating herself in disjointed
sentences between whiles.</p>

<p>In a very short time, the alarming suspicion was communicated
to the whole household, except the ladies, who
were awaiting the result of the search in terrible anxiety,
but not of positive fear, for they were sure now that the
girls had sought some convenient shelter, where they
were biding till the storm ceased.</p>

<p>A hurried consultation was held as to what should be
done; but no one could offer a suggestion that promised
to be of the smallest service.</p>

<p>The domestics retreated into a great greenhouse,
where they could command a view of the lake, the waters
of which now bore a sensational attraction in the eyes
of the terrified servants.</p>

<p>No one could take the direction of affairs, for they
were all subordinate servants, ignorant, and easily distracted.</p>

<p>It was agreed, finally, to go and consult Mrs. Ormsby,
on whom the task of breaking the tragical surmise to the
ladies would fall.</p>

<p>Justine had been carried into a conservatory, to get
her out of the way, and left there with a couple of housemaids.</p>

<p>A sad procession scrambled back to the house—a
somewhat noisy one, for every one had some eager, excited
remark to make, or some wondering exclamation
to utter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ormsby was at the top of the broad flight of
steps at the principal entrance, watching for the earliest
information. She did not venture to remain near Lady
Quaintree or Mrs. Dormer, but stood midway, as it were,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
between the terrified ladies and the band of explorers.
As they approached, she could plainly see the search had
been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Two or three eagerly came in advance of their fellows,
their mouths and eyes wide open, their visages full of excitement.</p>

<p>They had not yet begun to make their story intelligible,
however, when a loud shout, in a boyish treble, made
every one look round; and a thick-set lout was seen running
toward them, waving his hands in sign that his
business was of a most urgent nature, that would not
brook delay. This boy was George Netherclift.</p>

<p>He had, they all felt at once, come with some news of
the missing ones. But what kind of news? Were they
to hear confirmation of a tragedy? Or were the young
ladies safe and sound?</p>

<p>George Netherclift had been running the latter part
of the way, and was considerably out of breath. As he
paused, he glanced from one of the servants to another,
in doubt as to which to address.</p>

<p>“Well, boy,” exclaimed Mrs. Ormsby, in a sharp tone,
“what do you want? Speak quickly!”</p>

<p>“Zoombody to bring thay young ladies from thay ould
abbey,” said the boy. “Be quick, if ’ee please. They’ll
be main tired waiting.”</p>

<p>“They are safe and sound, then?” cried the housekeeper.
“But how in the world did they get to the ruined
abbey?”</p>

<p>“Doan’t know, missus. Perhaps they’ull know theysells.
Will ’ee zend zoombody quick, please?”</p>

<p>Of course, three or four male servants were at once
ready to accompany him. Mrs. Ormsby at first thought
of sending the carriage, but the abbey was nearly two
miles off by the road.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">PAUL DESFRAYNE’S REFLECTIONS.</p>


<p>With a heart as heavy as lead, Paul Desfrayne turned
back to rejoin the two girls, when he had ascertained
that, though trembling a little from nervous fright, his
horse, Greyburn, was quite safe. He thought what a
fortunate dispensation of Providence it would have been
had the One Hundred and Tenth Regiment been ordered
on foreign service—say, to China or Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>How many poor fellows had been separated from all
they loved best, never to behold adored faces more this
side the grave, banished into semisolitude, while he was
forced to abide within range of his dreaded Nemesis!</p>

<p>When he again appeared within the little chapel, he
was by no means lively company. Cold, abstracted, silent,
he seemed to make no effort to arouse himself. He
was thinking, indeed, as his eyes wandered to the high
windows through which the steady downpour of rain
could be clearly seen, what a striking emblem of his life
this black, pitiless storm might be.</p>

<p>Lois regarded him through her long, drooping eyelashes
with mingled feelings of admiration and pique.
Her belief that his thoughts were with another gained
fresh impetus.</p>

<p>“Yet,” she said to herself, “why need he be so uncivil
to me? Perhaps he imagines that if he were to be ordinarily
attentive, I might flatter myself he meant to ask
me to fulfil the hateful bargain. I would not marry him
if he tried to persuade me to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The hot blood swept in wrathful waves over her face,
just now paled by affright and her fit of syncope. Anger
made her draw her slight figure up to its full height;
and when Captain Desfrayne turned and addressed some
trifling remark to her, she replied with a frigid coldness
that struck even herself as being ungrateful and ungracious.</p>

<p>Blanche was more than ever persuaded that there had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
been a stormy quarrel, and that even yet neither chose
to advance one step toward reconciliation.</p>

<p>It was a relief to the three when hurrying footsteps
and the sound of excited voices showed that help was at
hand.</p>

<p>In a few minutes several men servants, headed by the
rough-pated boy who had gone in search of them, were
pressing into the chapel. One carried shawls and wraps,
and another some wine, in case the young ladies and their
deliverer should be faint.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!—oh, dear!—oh, dear!” cried Blanche, with
a great sigh. “What <i>will</i> mama and Lady Quaintree
say? How I shall be scolded and cried over! It has been
my fault entirely.”</p>

<p>“We were both to blame,” answered Lois.</p>

<p>“No; I planned our escapade, and persuaded you, and
forgot to make our boat fast.”</p>

<p>“The boat would have been of no use to you, Miss
Dormer, in such a storm,” said Captain Desfrayne.</p>

<p>“True. It has been a most unlucky affair altogether,”
sighed Blanche.</p>

<p>“I presume you are now quite safe in charge of these
good people,” said the young man. “There will be no
impropriety in leaving you, I trust—you and Miss Turquand?”</p>

<p>He bent his eyes on the floor, fixing them on a flat
tombstone at his feet, as if feeling half-guilty in thus
wishing to desert them.</p>

<p>“Why do you need to leave us, Captain Desfrayne?”
demanded Blanche, in a sharp, ringing tone, indicating
great surprise and a dash of displeasure. “Are you
obliged to go?”</p>

<p>“I—I must return to my quarters,” answered he, still
avoiding her glance.</p>

<p>“Oh! it will be impossible for you to go without seeing
Lady Quaintree, at least,” protested Miss Dormer.
“Besides, it is nearer to the barracks from the principal
gates of the Hall. You must, at least, pass through with
us, and just see Lady Quaintree and mama.”</p>

<p>Paul glanced swiftly at Lois. She was standing up,
the pride of a young empress dilating her figure, displayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
in the turn of her head. Her face was half-averted,
as if she would not deign to take part in the
argument, but her fingers were twitching nervously in
one another.</p>

<p>“Why should this strange mistrust—this presentiment
of deadly ill, haunt me?” Paul asked himself. “There
is no danger of my falling in love with this girl, and as
little of her honoring me with any tender regards. Probably
her heart is already fully occupied with the image
of some one else. This vague fear is simply absurd, and
I must master it. I am unwell, and my nerves are unstrung.
Perhaps I may shortly find an opportunity of
explaining to her how I am really situated. It would be
better to speak to her myself than to leave the painful
duty to others.”</p>

<p>He gave way to Blanche’s arguments, with a tolerable
grace, though alleging that he saw no reason why he
should feel it necessary to see the elder ladies.</p>

<p>One of the servants was directed to get his horse, and
bring it round to the front of Flore Hall; then the party
moved in the direction of the house.</p>

<p>Lois was determined on not giving way again, but she
was faint and giddy, and at length was compelled to accept
the support of Paul Desfrayne’s arm.</p>

<p>Not a word was exchanged on the way, though it
seemed of a wearisome length.</p>

<p>Another profound sigh escaped Blanche as they reached
the end.</p>

<p>“I am thankful we have you, Captain Desfrayne, as
a sort of shield,” she half-laughingly exclaimed. “They
cannot scold us so terribly when you are by, and when
you depart the worst will be over.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ormsby had informed Lady Quaintree and Mrs.
Dormer of the state of affairs; but although aware that
the girls were in safety, the ladies had fallen into dreadful
agitation.</p>

<p>The meeting might readily be imagined, but would
baffle description. For some minutes the elder ladies
were so much absorbed by rejoicings, tears, kisses, reproaches,
that they hardly noticed the stranger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>When Lois and Blanche had managed to give some intelligible
account of their adventures, Paul Desfrayne
was obliged to undergo a fresh shower of thanks, which
were most distasteful to him.</p>

<p>“How can I contrive to escape?” he was asking himself,
when Lady Quaintree startled him by saying:</p>

<p>“And we must really insist on your staying to dinner,
Captain Desfrayne. You would catch your death of cold
if you were to go out again while this heavy rain lasts.”</p>

<p>The young man started back.</p>

<p>“You are very kind, madam,” he murmured. “But I—I
could not stay, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“Come, sir, I must exercise an old woman’s authority,
and forbid you to leave us,” cried Lady Quaintree laughingly.
“Your mother is, I may say, an old friend of mine,
and I could not answer to her if her son met with any
mishap on leaving any house where I might be supposed
to have a voice. We owe you the safety of these wilful
girls, and you must allow us to see to your welfare. If
the rain does not abate, you must not ride back, but, if
you refuse to honor us by remaining under this roof for
the night, must accept the use of one of the carriages in
the coach-house.”</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree was playing against her own interests;
but common charity would not have permitted her to let
a dog go out in that sullen, dashing, persistent rain.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne looked at the disheartening prospect
from the windows, and resigned himself to his fate.</p>

<p>Without, all looked so dismal and forbidding—out
<i>there</i>, where his evil past lay crouching, ever ready to
spring up and confront him. Within here all seemed so
soft and inviting with this white and gold, and velvet
couches, and flowers in rich profusion, and these dulcet-toned,
high-bred women, symbolic of the brilliant, tempting
present, which beckoned to him, sirenlike.</p>

<p>“You are very kind—too kind, madam,” he said, bowing
low, and speaking in a constrained, husky voice.</p>

<p>So it was settled he should dine with them; and the
girls went away to change their dresses.</p>

<p>Mama Dormer had brought a small portmanteau over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
in the carriage with her, containing “a few things” required
by Blanche during her brief stay.</p>

<p>Lois being in black did not need much alteration in
her attire, but by means of a trained, black skirt, and a
thin, high, white bodice, and a suite of jet ornaments, she
contrived to make an effective dinner-costume.</p>

<p>By the time they rustled back to the drawing-room,
where the little party was to assemble for dinner, the
servants were lighting the wax tapers, causing a soft
glitter to illuminate the apartment.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased. The sultry heat began to come
back, and all the windows had been thrown open, admitting
the luscious odors of the countless flowers in the
gardens. The scent of the summer roses was almost
overcoming after the rain.</p>

<p>The last, dying rays of the setting sun dyed the sky,
from which all but a few floating, feathery clouds had
vanished away.</p>

<p>Lois and Blanche looked irresistibly beautiful as they
entered the room, the one in her simple, somber attire,
the other in a shimmering green silken robe, trimmed
with white lace, and frilled fine muslin.</p>

<p>As Lois came in, Paul Desfrayne’s eyes met hers, and
by some mysterious fascination, neither he nor she could
remove their gaze.</p>

<p>The young girl trembled from some undefined feeling—a
sense of mingled pain and pleasure.</p>

<p>Paul felt as if some gauntleted hand had mercilessly
compressed his heart. He shivered as if from cold.</p>

<p>“I believe some malignant genius drove me out this
day,” he thought.</p>

<p>Lois averted her eyes by a violent effort of will.</p>

<p>“Why does he look at me like this, when he is so
cold and repellent in his manners?” she indignantly asked
herself.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree caught the glance, and partly interpreted
the looks of both.</p>

<p>“I wish I had had the sense to stop at home,” she said
mentally. “I am afraid my Gerald’s chance will be a
small one. We really must get away to-morrow at latest.
Luckily, the gallant knight errant is pinned safely down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
in this remote part of the world, and I must coax Lois
to go to Switzerland, or some other comfortable place, to
give my boy a fair start in the race.”</p>

<p>Her ladyship kept a pretty sharp watch on the two
young people—Lois and her handsome young trustee.
But, during dinner, nothing rewarded her for her vigilance,
or, to speak more correctly, she was absolutely
rewarded by observing that they did not once exchange
a look, and only noticed each other’s presence when
obliged to do so by the etiquette of the table.</p>

<p>This apparent mutual misunderstanding puzzled her a
good deal. Captain Desfrayne’s reserved manner with
his beautiful young charge perplexed her extremely. That
he should not endeavor to improve his opportunity of obtaining
favor with the young girl seemed inexplicable;
and when she found that both were evidently resolved
on steadfastly declining to pass the ice-bound line that
divided them, she marveled more and more.</p>

<p>“There is some undercurrent here which I do not understand,”
she thought. “It seems strange, but there is
certainly some ill-will between them. What can the matter
be?”</p>

<p>Had not Lois been her constant companion for the last
four years, during which time the young girl had been
completely ignorant of Paul Desfrayne’s existence, Lady
Quaintree might have imagined, with Blanche Dormer,
that there was a lovers’ quarrel.</p>

<p>After cudgeling her brains for an explanation of this
mystery, a possible solution presented itself. Lady Quaintree
knew family pride to be one of Mrs. Desfrayne’s
weak points, and perhaps this peculiarity might be magnified
in her son. Remembering that if the refusal to
obey the old man’s whim came from his side, it would
involve on his part a heavy pecuniary loss, she concluded
that he wished to induce Miss Turquand to think him a
very undesirable lover, and thus to cause the refusal to
come from her.</p>

<p>This view having presented itself, her ladyship wavered
in the resolution of at once quitting Flore Hall.
If Captain Desfrayne was determined not to profit by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
his advantageous position, but to drive Miss Turquand
to refuse him, would he not be an eligible ally?</p>

<p>Many a girl, she knew, slighted by one, eagerly if hastily
accepted the next that offered.</p>

<p>Yet, until she could ascertain <i>why</i> Paul Desfrayne did
not relish the bride proposed to him, she might be playing
a dangerous game in allowing him to be too near her
lovely protégée.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree felt thoroughly perplexed and unsettled,
in fact, and could only arrive finally at the conclusion
that the wisest plan would be to let herself be guided
by a cautious observation of the course of events.</p>

<p>“I wish we could have brought Gerald down with us,”
she sighed. “However, the way must be clearer in a few
days.”</p>

<p>At Lois’ earnest entreaty, Lady Quaintree had taken
all but the actual name of mistress in the house. She
sat at the head of the table, and played the role of hostess.
Owing to her consummate tact, the dinner did not pass
so drearily as it might otherwise have done.</p>

<p>She gave the signal to rise, and smilingly told Captain
Desfrayne he should have half an hour’s grace to
smoke a cigar if he pleased.</p>

<p>The ladies adjourned to the white drawing-room,
where a soft glitter of wax tapers shed a pleasant, mellow
light.</p>

<p>Squire Dormer had arranged to come for his wife and
daughter at eight or nine o’clock. When the storm broke,
Mrs. Dormer had feared she might be obliged to stay all
night, but now the sky had cleared, the sultry heat already
nearly dried up the pools of water lying on the
garden-walks, and the silver moon had risen in royal
splendor.</p>

<p>Blanche flew to the piano—a superb instrument as far
as appearance went, but it was very decidedly out of tune.
There was no music anywhere visible, but Miss Dormer
sat down and began playing morsels and snatches of melody
from recollection. Then she asked Lois to sing.</p>

<p>Lois had always been accustomed to so implicitly obey
the wishes of those about her, that she did not think of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
refusing, but took Blanche’s seat and ran her fingers
skilfully over the keys.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel very well,” she mildly protested. “But I
will do my best.”</p>

<p>“Don’t overexert yourself, my love,” said Lady Quaintree.</p>

<p>“I should be delighted to hear you,” Mrs. Dormer
remarked, almost at the same moment.</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne heard the chords of the piano from
his solitary retreat, and, being passionately fond of
music, he came out on the terrace and moved into the
leafy shadow, from whence he could view the interior
of the drawing-room without being himself seen.</p>

<p>Lois had just seated herself as he took up this station.
The mellow, amber rays of the wax lights fell on her
graceful figure and on her stately head. From the spot
where he stood, Paul Desfrayne could watch her every
movement. Unconsciously to himself, he drank in the
sweet poison of love at every glance as he observed the
pure, statuesque lines and curves of that queenly form,
the rich, silken shimmer of the lovely hair, the harmonious,
suave grace of each motion.</p>

<p>“I will summon up courage to-night, if I can possibly
find an opportunity,” he thought, “and tell her the truth.
I may have a chance of speaking to her. After to-night,
it will probably be months before we meet again, if we
ever do meet. She seems sweet and amiable; she is undoubtedly
as beautiful as a dream. Probably she will pity
my unhappy position, and sympathize with my misfortunes,
even if they arise from my own folly. What a
madman I have been! Truly they say: ‘Marry in haste,
repent at leisure.’ What would I not give or do to be
free once more!”</p>

<p>Lois began to sing. She had thought for a minute or
two, and then struck the chords of a graceful symphony
to a pathetic Irish air.</p>

<p>Her voice was clear and deliciously sweet—pure as
that of an angel. Thanks to Lady Quaintree, it had been
most carefully trained, and the young girl had a sensitive
feeling for the words as well as the music of what
she sang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne’s relentless memory went back to those
feverish days when he had listened, spellbound in that
heated theater at Florence, to the siren notes of the woman
who had destroyed his happiness.</p>

<p>The contrast between Lucia Guiscardini and Lois
Turquand was as great as between darkness and light.
In every respect they totally differed. The one was a
magnificent tigress, regal in beauty, haughty and unbending
in temper; the other a gentle white doe, lovely
and soft.</p>

<p>Presently the song ceased. Blanche’s laced handkerchief
stole to her eyes for a moment, then she kissed her
friend by way of thanks. There was a little buzz of well-bred,
musical voices for a minute or two, and then the
girls emerged on the upper terrace as if coming out to
breathe the fresh air.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne drew back still farther within the
sheltering gloom, rendered all the more secure by the
increasing splendor of the moonlight, which caused
strange, sudden contrasts of light and shade in the gardens.
The faint scent of his cigar might have warned
the girls of his proximity, but they did not notice it.
He was, however, out of ear-shot.</p>

<p>For a moment he thought of ascending the short flight
of steps leading from the lower to the upper terrace, but
feeling that in his present depressed state he would be
poor company, he elected to stay where he was.</p>

<p>Within half an hour he resolved to take leave of his
entertainers, and ride home.</p>

<p>“Home!” he said to himself bitterly. “I have no home—no
prospect of home. No home, no peace, no rest. I
am like a gambler who has staked and lost a fortune at
one fatal throw. And my unrest is made all the more
poignant by the tempting will-o’-the-wisp fate has sent
to dance before me, mockingly.”</p>

<p class="center">BLANCHE DORMER’S SURPRISE.</p>


<p>The peace and purity of the night indisposed Lois to
talk, and Blanche was meditating on how far the proprieties
might admit of her sounding her new friend on
the subject of the supposed estrangement. So neither
spoke for several minutes.</p>

<p>“A night like this always reminds me of the moonlight-scene
in the ‘Merchant of Venice,’” Blanche said,
at length. “I was afraid the storm would last until
morning; perhaps I was also afraid mama would scold
terribly. But I think when she is really alarmed, she is
too much upset to be able to scold in proper style. I
like these summer storms; the weird lightning has such a
mystic beauty of its own. I lost my head this afternoon,
but that was because we were in such a dangerous place,
and a little because I was frightened on your account, as
you seemed so terrified.”</p>

<p>“I am nervous in a storm, always,” Lois said deprecatingly,
for she felt ashamed of her weakness.</p>

<p>“I think it was a special mercy your friend, Captain
Desfrayne, came to our rescue. No doubt you were
amazed when you saw him. But I suppose you knew he
was coming down to this neighborhood?”</p>

<p>“I know nothing of his movements or plans,” Lois replied
calmly. “I never heard his name until last Friday.”</p>

<p>Miss Dormer absolutely sprang back, and stared at her
new friend in speechless surprise. Her theory had been
upset so precipitately that she was at a loss for words.</p>

<p>“I—I thought—I fancied—that is——” she stammered,
for she felt fairly confounded, and much as if
she had walked into a trap.</p>

<p>She heartily wished she could entirely control her
amazement and vexation at the absurdity of her mistake,
but her looks and manner betrayed her.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” innocently inquired Lois.</p>

<p>“Why—that is——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“You hesitate, Blanche?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will be offended.”</p>

<p>“With you? Impossible. Pray be frank with me.”</p>

<p>“You promised not to be vexed?”</p>

<p>“I could not be vexed with you, my dear friend. What
did you think?”</p>

<p>“Honestly, I thought you and Captain Desfrayne had
had a lovers’ quarrel,” Blanche said.</p>

<p>Lois broke into a peal of silvery laughter, caused
partly by surprise, partly by pique and anger—not toward
Blanche, but toward the unhappy captain. She
threw back her head with a little scornful gesture.</p>

<p>“You thought so? What could have led you to imagine
such a strange thing?”</p>

<p>“Because—I don’t know how I came to be so foolish,
but—well, I saw him look at you——”</p>

<p>“At me?”</p>

<p>“Aye, and you at him—come, you as good as promised
not to be cross—look and speak as if—as if—that is to
say—well, in truth, I can hardly say what caused me to
jump to my odd conclusion, but I did make the silly
spring, and I find myself landed on exceedingly unpleasant
ground.”</p>

<p>Lois had known Blanche only two days, although she
felt a strong presentiment that the friendship just cemented
would endure for a lifetime. Blanche was the
first friend she had ever possessed, and she was sure she
might be trusted, yet prudence caused her to hesitate before
entrusting Miss Dormer with the secret of her
strange relationship with Paul Desfrayne.</p>

<p>Blanche was fairly puzzled, and her feminine curiosity
aroused. Quite confident that Lois had spoken truly in
saying that Captain Desfrayne was almost a stranger to
her, she yet could not help believing that there was
some good reason for her thinking that some more than
ordinary feeling caused a mutual interest or dislike.</p>

<p>Lois placed her arm caressingly round Blanche’s waist,
and laid her cheek on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Blanche,” she said, “I am going to tell you something
about myself and Captain Desfrayne, which will, I
have no doubt, surprise you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>Miss Dormer shrank a little, as if she had been guilty
of trying to surprise a confidence she was not entitled to.</p>

<p>“I hope,” she said, “you do not think me inquisitive.
I am sorry I allowed myself to make any remarks.”</p>

<p>Lois smiled.</p>

<p>“You must let me enjoy the privileges of a friend,”
she replied. “If you will let me tell you, I think it would
be a solace to me. For although Lady Quaintree is so
good and so kind, yet——”</p>

<p>She paused; for it would be impossible to enter into
any of the feelings which barred a perfect confidence between
herself and her late mistress. But Miss Dormer
partially comprehended, and pressed her hands warmly
in token of sympathy and encouragement.</p>

<p>“No doubt you will wonder, knowing that my acquaintanceship
with him is of so recent a date—no doubt
you will marvel to hear that I am half-engaged to marry
Captain Desfrayne,” began Lois.</p>

<p>“My dear!” was all Blanche could say, opening her
eyes as wide as they could expand.</p>

<p>“Yes. I can scarcely believe the story is real.”</p>

<p>Lois repeated to her the history of Mr. Vere Gardiner’s
will. Blanche listened in silent amazement.</p>

<p>“How extraordinary! Then, why—why——”</p>

<p>“Pray be as frank with me as I have been with you,”
Lois entreated.</p>

<p>“Why does he behave in such an odd way toward you?
Does the proposition, or whatever you may call it, displease
him?”</p>

<p>“I have had no explanation from him, nor is one likely
to take place. I am as ignorant as you are of his opinion
on the matter.”</p>

<p>“What is your own?”</p>

<p>“I may truly say I feel mortified and vexed by being
disposed of like a bale of goods——”</p>

<p>“Not exactly, dearest girl. You are left an option.”</p>

<p>“I do not like Captain Desfrayne.”</p>

<p>“That can scarcely be wondered at, since he treats you
so coldly—almost rudely. What a strange old man this
Vere Gardiner must have been! Why should he take
such a singular whim into his head?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>“I do not know. You now know as much—or as little—as
I do myself.”</p>

<p>“It is a riddle,” said Blanche. “What does Lady
Quaintree say?”</p>

<p>“She is very much pleased about the money and
landed property—as pleased and interested as if I were
her own child; but she has not said much about the proposition
of marriage.”</p>

<p>“I suppose she wishes to see more of this gentleman.
This afternoon, when I first saw Captain Desfrayne, I
liked him: he seemed nice, and had such a gentle way
with him, and his voice was pleasant. But now I have
taken a prejudice against him.”</p>

<p>At this moment, Blanche caught sight of her father,
Squire Dormer, who had just entered the drawing-room,
where the elder ladies sat.</p>

<p>“Wait for me one moment here, dear Miss Turquand,”
she said. “I will run and ask papa if I must return to-night.
Oh! I do hope he will let me stay till to-morrow
with you. Do you leave in the morning?”</p>

<p>“Lady Quaintree arranges everything,” answered Lois.
“It will be just as she orders.”</p>

<p>Blanche went back to the drawing-room. Lois remained
on the terrace, idly watching the weird shadows
and sharp, silvery lights.</p>

<p>A step on the lower terrace for a moment alarmed her.
But a glance assured her that Captain Desfrayne was the
intruder on the quiet of that place. He was near enough
to be able to address her without raising his voice.</p>

<p>Not one word of the dialogue just interrupted had
reached his ears.</p>

<p>“Are you not afraid of taking cold, Miss Turquand?”
he asked, really for want of something better to say.</p>

<p>“Thanks, no. It is such a lovely summer’s night. I
am going back to the drawing-room in one moment,” replied
Lois.</p>

<p>With a quick movement, Paul Desfrayne ascended the
steps leading from the lower to the upper terrace, and in
an instant was by her side.</p>

<p>“Miss Turquand——” he began, then his courage and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
the power of expressing his scarcely formed ideas utterly
failed him.</p>

<p>Lois’ heart throbbed painfully for a moment or two.
She looked at Captain Desfrayne, then averted her eyes
without saying a word.</p>

<p>“I wished—I may not see you again for a long time,
and I thought it would be better to explain myself certain
circumstances which it is of paramount importance
you should know than to trust others to do so, or to endeavor
to commit them to writing.”</p>

<p>“Circumstances?” repeated Lois. “Of what kind?”</p>

<p>“Circumstances connected entirely with my own history;
but as—must I say unhappily?—one who might be
deemed the benefactor of us both—that one has chosen
to link our fate—your destiny and mine—together, to a
certain extent, it is your right to learn what otherwise——”</p>

<p>Paul felt conscious that every little speech he had attempted
had proved a wretched failure. He feared that
the task he had undertaken would prove beyond his
strength or skill. What form of words should he use?
How possibly bring the subject of his marriage forward?
It was difficult enough in one way to break the seal of
secrecy on the fatal topic to his mother; with this girl of
eighteen it would be a thousand times more so.</p>

<p>“Miss Turquand,” he began, once again making another
effort, “one chief reason why I have not before
informed you of these circumstances has been that I
really have not had the opportunity. The news that—in
fact, that is to say, the knowledge that I was to—in a
word, the contents of Mr. Vere Gardiner’s will came
upon me like a thunderclap. I did not even know your
name until last Friday, when I had the pleasure of seeing
you for the first time. Why Mr. Vere Gardiner
should have seen fit to make such a singular arrangement,
I cannot conceive. I met him but once, so far as
I am aware. He knew nothing of my private affairs.
No doubt he meant well. It would, perhaps, be ungrateful
on my part to find fault with his good intentions; but
it is to be regretted that he could not fix on some more
worthy object of his bounty than myself, or, at least, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
he attached conditions to his munificent gifts which it is
absolutely impossible I can fulfil.”</p>

<p>Lois’ eyes were kindling with the varying sensations
that rose in her heart as she listened. With the swiftness
of an already overexcited brain, her imagination ran
rapidly through every conceivable range of impediments,
except the one that really existed.</p>

<p>She looked so lovely, so graceful, so ethereal in the
cross-light, that, as Paul Desfrayne looked down upon
her fair, English face and beautiful figure, he felt a
strange yearning desire to take her for a moment in
his arms, and press one kiss upon the half-open rose-bud
lips. More than ever he cursed the mad folly that
had made him link those heavy chains upon his life that
might never be loosened this side the grave.</p>

<p>What was he about to tell her? Lois rested her hand
on the stone ledge of the balustrade; for she felt unnerved
and agitated.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne was silent for some moments. Lois
had only spoken once since he had joined her.</p>

<p>Blanche, having ascertained to her great satisfaction
that she would be allowed to stay all night, and partly settled
a newly started scheme for a tour of some weeks
with the Quaintrees, was about to rush back to Lois’
side. But her quick glance had discovered how her
friend was employed, and she drew back before she had
made three steps. She discreetly returned into the drawing-room,
and sat down at the piano.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree began to wonder greatly why Captain
Desfrayne had not come to ask for a cup of coffee, and
she now missed her young companion. It did not suit
her plan of operations to let them have an opportunity of
entering into any mutual explanations of which she might
not be immediately cognizant. Therefore, observing that
Blanche was alone, she asked:</p>

<p>“Where is Lois, my dear?”</p>

<p>“I left her on the terrace, ma’am,” answered Blanche,
turning round on her music-stool.</p>

<p>“Alone, Blanche?”</p>

<p>“Yes—no. I did leave her alone; but I think she is
talking to Captain Desfrayne now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, indeed! They are very foolish. I am sure they
will take cold,” said my lady, with an air of careless semi-interest.</p>

<p>Blanche turned again to her board of black and white
ivory keys, and began running brilliant roulades. Mrs.
Dormer asked her husband some questions about the state
of the roads after the deluge of rain that had fallen, and
in a few minutes Lady Quaintree found that she had an
excellent opportunity of rising almost unobserved, and
moving across to the windows, which all opened directly
upon the terrace.</p>

<p>She moved gently, with a soft, silken rustle, from one
window to another, until she arrived at one where she
could command a perfect view of the two figures standing
in the moonlight.</p>

<p>It thus happened that, as Paul Desfrayne spoke those
words declaring his inability to carry out any share in the
dead man’s wishes, Lady Quaintree was in the act of
drawing open the window against which he had accidentally
placed himself.</p>

<p>Her ladyship would have disdained to play the part of
eavesdropper, for she was a woman of high principle, although
she deemed herself justified in thus interrupting
what might be a critical explanation. She, therefore,
heard nothing of what the young officer had been saying.</p>

<p>Lois could not conceive why there should be such a
tender sorrow in Captain Desfrayne’s eyes, such a pathetic
ring in his voice, such an echo of grief and despair
in his words. With an eager unrest, she waited for the
next words, which should explain the reason of the
young man’s inability to profit by the clauses in the old
man’s will. But, instead of the tender tones of his voice,
the suave, well-bred accents of Lady Quaintree sounded
in her ears. With a great start, she turned and faced her
ladyship; Paul Desfrayne did the same.</p>

<p>“My dearest pet, you really ought not to linger here
in the night air,” said my lady. “I fancy Mrs. Dormer
has been wondering where you have vanished to. Really,
however, I am not surprised, the beauty of the night has
tempted you to breathe its freshness and fragrance; it is
so close and sultry within. Give me your arm, my love;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
I will take just one turn, and then we will go in and let
Captain Desfrayne and Mrs. Dormer have a little music.”</p>

<p>“Allow me, madam,” said the young man, offering his
arm.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree passed her hand lightly through the
proffered support, and, thus escorted, promenaded to and
fro for about five minutes; Lois, on her left, attending
her. Her ladyship was in charming spirits, and to any
less preoccupied companions would have been most
amusing.</p>

<p>The lively nothings she rattled off fell on dull and indifferent
ears, however, and she could extract little beyond
abstracted monosyllables from Captain Desfrayne,
and an occasional languid smile or a half-absent “yes” or
“no” from Miss Turquand.</p>

<p>“Would it be of any use offering you shelter for the
night, Captain Desfrayne?” she asked, with a winning
smile. “My dear young friend has appointed me viceroy
over her house for the present. We shall be delighted
to show you as much hospitality as our means will admit.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, and I am already indebted to you
for the goodness and consideration which you have this
day shown me,” answered Paul Desfrayne. “But I really
must return to my quarters to-night.”</p>

<p>“It will be a long and lonely ride,” objected Lady
Quaintree. “Can we order one of the carriages for your
service?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. I should greatly prefer riding.”</p>

<p>“Do you need a groom, or a guide of any kind?”</p>

<p>“I knew this neighborhood perfectly well when a boy,
and have not forgotten one lane or valley or hedgerow,
I believe.”</p>

<p>Presently Lady Quaintree turned to go in, saying they
must not neglect their other guests.</p>

<p>She passed in first, Paul Desfrayne lingered for a moment,
and involuntarily fixed his eyes upon Lois. They
were full of an unspoken eloquence, and revealed volumes
of despair, of regret, of deep and mute feelings
which rose like some troubled revelation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>Lois could not but read this glance, which perplexed
her more than his few bitter words of absolute renunciation
had done.</p>

<p>The young man knew that this chance for an explanation
was gone. When might the next occur? He scarcely
knew whether to feel relieved by the postponement of
a painful duty, or vexed by the fact that he was worse
placed than if he had remained absolutely silent.</p>

<p>“I can write to her to-morrow,” he thought, though
he doubted if he could nerve himself to the task.</p>

<p>“What can he have wished to tell me?” Lois asked
herself vainly; for although she racked her brain for an
answer, none sufficiently plausible presented itself.</p>

<p>They were not alone for a single moment during the
remaining hour that Paul Desfrayne lingered. The
Dormers went past the barracks on their way home, but
he declined a seat in their carriage, as he preferred to
ride, he said.</p>

<p>He left the house with them, however, riding a short
way by their carriage, and then, putting spurs to his
horse, dashed at almost a reckless pace toward his quarters.</p>

<p>It might almost be imagined that a kind of second
sight, some sort of spiritual influence, was drawing him
to the place where Gilardoni awaited him.</p>

<p>As he took leave of Miss Turquand, he held her hand
for some brief moments, and again looked into the clear
depths of her eyes.</p>

<p>A deep sigh escaped him as he released the hand he
had half-unconsciously retained. Lois heard the sigh, and
it was echoed in her heart.</p>

<p>Alas! What was the fatal impediment? Not dislike
for herself—she felt sure of that. Her pique and resentment
were rapidly melting away under the dangerous
fire of love and pity.</p>

<p>He left her a prey to unrest, impatience, wonderment,
the only solace being that she felt confident he would
take the earliest opportunity of giving her the explanation
thus vexatiously interrupted. She surmised that a letter
might possibly reach her some time the next day, or perhaps
he might call. It would be so natural for him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
come, with the object of ascertaining how she and Miss
Dormer were after their fright.</p>

<p>Somehow, she did not care to inform Lady Quaintree
of what he had said, nor did her ladyship make the slightest
approach to an inquiry. But when Lady Quaintree
proposed to quit Flore Hall early the following day, she
eagerly desired to stay, alleging truly that she was anything
but well, as her fainting-fit and the alarm she had
suffered had unhinged her nerves.</p>

<p>“Just as you please, my love. I will not dictate to you
in your own house, and certainly you and dear Blanche
do look very pale, so perhaps a day’s rest will be desirable.
But really I shall not be able to remain for more
than one day longer. I have so many engagements——”</p>

<p>And she affected to consult a dainty blue-and-gold
note-book, which assuredly did contain a sufficiently full
program for the week, but which would not have bound
her if she had not found it convenient.</p>

<p>With Blanche, Lois was more open. Miss Dormer
came for a little while into her room, which the girls
would gladly have shared, and listened with absorbed
interest to the brief account of the mysterious words
spoken on the terrace.</p>

<p>When Lois paused, Blanche reflected seriously.</p>

<p>“You have not consulted Lady Quaintree yet, since he
said these singular things?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Lois, in a low, constrained voice.</p>

<p>“Is it too late to speak to her now?”</p>

<p>Lois shrank back.</p>

<p>“I know it would be best,” she said; “and yet—and yet
I do not like to speak to her until I have something more
definite to say. She has always been kind and good to
me; but you must remember that she has been my mistress,
far above me in every respect; and I can scarcely——I
know I am wrong, ungrateful, and yet——”</p>

<p>Blanche smiled, and shrugged her pretty shoulders almost
imperceptibly.</p>

<p>“I understand,” she said, very softly. “I suppose Captain
Desfrayne will explain himself to her. I wonder
much he has not tried to do so to-night. He might easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
have found, or made, an opportunity. You have told me
exactly what he said?”</p>

<p>“Word for word. It seems imprinted on my memory,
and every sentence seems still sounding in my ears. I
suppose I was so startled that it made a particular impression
on me.”</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you what my opinion is? Probably within
a few days—perhaps to-morrow—you will learn the
truth. But may I hazard a guess?”</p>

<p>“Pray tell me what you think, my dear friend.”</p>

<p>Blanche fixed her eyes on the pale face of Lois.</p>

<p>“It is my belief,” she said, very slowly, speaking as if
deliberately—“it is my firm conviction that he is secretly
married.”</p>

<p>Lois shrank back once more. Such an idea had not
occurred to her; but she could not refuse to see the probability
of the suggestion. She was unable to speak.
Somehow, ice seemed to fall upon her heart.</p>

<p>“Secretly married!” she at length echoed faintly. “Why
should he be ashamed or afraid to acknowledge such a
thing?”</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen,” replied Miss Dormer. “But
I believe such to be the fact. I have read and heard of
many cases where gentlemen, handsome and proud as
Captain Desfrayne, have married persons whom they
had every reason to be ashamed of. But he may not be
ashamed of his marriage, my dear. There are many
reasons why people conceal that they are married.”</p>

<p>Long after Blanche quitted her, Lois remained gazing
from her open window, painfully meditating. He was
perhaps, then, already married?</p>

<p>Tired, agitated, weak from fright and from the strain
on her nervous system, the young girl rested her head
upon her hands, and a few tears trickled over her fingers.
She started up.</p>

<p>“What folly!” she muttered. “Why do I dwell so
much on the words he spoke to-night? What does it
signify? I do not care for him. He is a stranger to me,
and likely to remain such. When I have been duly informed
of the reasons why he is unable to assist me in
doubling my fortune by marrying me, there will be an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
end of the matter. I am almost sorry now I did not
agree to Lady Quaintree’s suggestion, and return to
London to-morrow. Probably he will send a letter to her
ladyship by his servant some time to-morrow afternoon.
I do not wish to marry him. I will never marry any
one I do not love, and I have never yet seen any one
I could really care for. I will go to bed, and get to
sleep, as I ought to have done about two hours ago.”</p>

<p>She did go to bed; but the effort to sleep was quite
an abortive one. Feverishly she turned from side to
side, unable to rid herself of the memory of those eloquent
glances, those deeply regretful broken words, those
pathetic tones.</p>

<p>Until at last she arrived at the conclusion that she
would willingly have forfeited her newly acquired fortune
never to have heard of or seen Paul Desfrayne.</p>

<p class="center">THE BREAK OF DAWN.</p>


<p>It was with difficulty Gilardoni could curb his impatient
desire for his master’s return. Could he by any
possibility have imagined in which direction to seek for
him, he would have started off in quest before the storm
was well exhausted. But he was absolutely a stranger
in this part of the world, and for aught he could tell, his
master might be the same.</p>

<p>He was perforce obliged to remain in Captain Desfrayne’s
rooms in absolute inaction, listening with keenly
strained watchfulness to every sound, every footfall of
man or beast.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the rooms did not overlook the yard
through which the young officer must enter the barracks,
so Gilardoni did not enjoy the half-irritating consolation
of watching the gate by which he would come.</p>

<p>It was very late before there was the slightest sign of
Captain Desfrayne’s coming.</p>

<p>In fact, Gilardoni at length, somehow, lost count, and
was only recalled to his eager watch by a gentle touch
upon his shoulder. He sprang to his feet, unaware that
he had fallen asleep.</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne had come into the room quietly. At
first he had thought of letting the poor tired fellow have
his sleep to the end in peace; but, finding he needed his
services, he had aroused him.</p>

<p>“No matter, my good Gilardoni,” he said, with that
pleasant, winning, yet sad, smile that had become habitual
to him. “I have no doubt you are tired waiting for
me. I am dog-tired myself. This afternoon, I was
caught in the storm, and had the good luck”—there was
an imperceptible shade of irony in his tone—“to find
shelter in a friend’s house, so was delayed. Will
you——”</p>

<p>The words died on his lips. Gilardoni had placed the
tiny packet in the silver tissue-paper on the table, just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
within the rays of the lamp, and Paul Desfrayne’s glance
happened to light on it as he spoke.</p>

<p>With a hasty movement, he put out his hand to take
it up, but the Italian was more swift, and with the rapidity
of lightning covered the packet with the palm of his
hand, but without removing it from the table.</p>

<p>The two young men looked into each other’s face for
some moments. Not a sound was heard beyond the
monotonous tick-tick of the clock on the chimneypiece.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this?” demanded Captain
Desfrayne.</p>

<p>He recollected the night when he engaged this man as
his servant—it seemed months ago—when he had seen
him clench his fist at the pictured resemblance to Lucia
Guiscardini.</p>

<p>Gilardoni took up the tiny gold cross in its filmy covering,
and kept it in his hand.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he said, “this morning you dropped this—as I
supposed. I picked it up——”</p>

<p>“Both self-evident facts. As it happens to belong to
<i>me</i>, and you acknowledge my proprietorship, why do you
not restore it to me?” said Captain Desfrayne. “Do you
know what it is?”</p>

<p>Gilardoni laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>“I naturally opened the packet, in order to ascertain
what the contents might be,” he responded, “for I was
not certain until now that it had really been dropped
by you, sir. It is——”</p>

<p>“What is it? A gold cross, a pendant for a watch-chain.”</p>

<p>“More than that.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Sir, may I ask you a question?”</p>

<p>“A thousand, if you will let me have my own property,
and be brief enough to let me get to bed within half an
hour, for I sorely need rest.”</p>

<p>“Sir—my good master, to whom I owe so much kindness
and charity—I am not going to ask this question
out of impertinent curiosity, but—but from a sufficiently
reasonable and strong motive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“Come, let us have the question without further preamble.”</p>

<p>“I will ask you two questions. Did you buy this cross,
or was it given to you?”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne hesitated before replying, as a man
in the witness-box might do for fear of criminating
himself.</p>

<p>“It was given to me,” he at length replied.</p>

<p>“By a woman?”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne looked keenly at his questioner.
The idea that he was a former lover of the beautiful
Italian prima donna’s, again occurred to him.</p>

<p>“If it will afford you any gratification to know, I do
not object to admitting that it was given to me by a
woman,” he said.</p>

<p>“By an Italian?”</p>

<p>“By an Italian? Yes.”</p>

<p>“It was a love-gift?”</p>

<p>An exclamation of anger escaped Gilardoni’s master,
and he impatiently stretched out his hand.</p>

<p>“Enough of this nonsense!” he exclaimed, with displeasure.
“Give me that packet, and get you to bed.
Your wits are addled by the nap you were betrayed into.”</p>

<p>Gilardoni moved a step nearer to Captain Desfrayne,
and, gripping him tightly by the wrist, looked with intent,
searching earnestness into his face, as if he would
read his soul. There was nothing sinister or menacing
in his attitude, gestures, or expression. He had simply
the appearance of a man carried away by some self-absorbing
desire to learn a fact of paramount interest to
himself.</p>

<p>“This cross,” he said, “was given to you by Lucia Guiscardini.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand why the fact should interest you,”
answered Paul Desfrayne. “It certainly did come from
her hand. What was Lucia Guiscardini to you, or you to
Lucia Guiscardini, that the sight of her gifts to another
should cause you so much emotion?”</p>

<p>“Did she tell you where she had obtained this toy?”
asked Gilardoni.</p>

<p>“I did not think of inquiring. She linked it on my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
watch-chain one day, and there was an end of the affair.”</p>

<p>“I knew this as well as if I had been present,” muttered
the Italian. “Oh! false, wicked, traitorous serpent!”</p>

<p>These latter words he spoke so rapidly in his native
language that his master did not catch their import.</p>

<p>“If you knew, why the deuce have you put yourself to
the trouble of asking so many questions? I should be
glad to know what you mean by cross-examining me in
this ridiculous manner. You apparently consider you
have no very good reason to like this same Lucia Guiscardini.
Has she done you any harm?”</p>

<p>“She has ruined my happiness—blighted my life—that
is all. No, I have no great reason to remember her with
feelings of good-will.”</p>

<p>“As you have asked me some questions, I may be allowed
the privilege of retaliating. May I ask if she jilted
you?”</p>

<p>“No. Oh! no. Would to Heaven she had done so, and
saved me these years of bitter hate and regret!”</p>

<p>“Is she your sister?” demanded Paul Desfrayne,
startled by the overthrow of the supposition he had so
readily built up.</p>

<p>“No. She is the only woman I have ever loved, or
can ever love again.”</p>

<p>“Do you still love her, or do you hate her for being so
far beyond you?”</p>

<p>Gilardoni regarded his master with a strange, inexplicable
look, and then broke into a low, savagely bitter
laugh.</p>

<p>“May I ask, sir,” he said, “if she jilted <i>you</i>? She was
quite capable of playing the coquette to amuse herself,
and then laughing in your face, for her soul was really
steeped in ambitious desires.”</p>

<p>“I believe, my good fellow, ambition was her besetting
sin—is still, if what folks say be true. No, she did not
jilt me. But you have not answered my question. Be
frank with me. Tell me why you hate this woman. Why
do you hate her—and yet, why do you feel anger at finding
her gifts in the possession of another?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>“This cross,” said Gilardoni, tearing it from its wrapper,
and holding it out at arm’s length, with a strange,
vindictive smile, “was my gift to her—given the day I
told her I loved her, and asked her——”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“She pretended she returned my love. Bah! Her
heart was as cold as ice. She cares for no one but herself.
She was born a peasant girl, yet never was princess
of blood royal more proud, more insolent, more resolved
to stand above the common herd. I adored her. I was
like one bereft of his senses when she was near me. She
had but to will, and I obeyed like the basest slave. Bah!
I made an idol and tricked it out with all the graces
of my love-smitten imagination, and fell down and worshiped
it. I believed that she was exactly what my
weak, foolish heart pictured her to be. I would have
raised her from her ignoble station, but not to the height
she desired to climb. To be a Russian princess, or the
lady of some great English milord, was her dream.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Paul Desfrayne, very quietly, yet he
felt that some great revelation was at hand. That the
revelation was to be to his advantage he did not hope.</p>

<p>“But not at the time when I linked about her neck the
chain that held this poor little gewgaw,” cried Gilardoni
excitedly. “No, no. At that time she was barely conscious
of her power to charm—just waking to the consciousness
of her dangerous charm of beauty. I was
her first victim, her first triumph. She was a girl of sixteen
then; I was about six or seven years her senior.
We had been neighbors and friends from childhood. I
taught her such songs and snatches of music as I occasionally
picked up, and she loved to warble the chants
and psalms she heard at chapel. She had not discovered
that she had a fortune in her throat. If she had not
found out <i>that</i>, we might have been a happy, contented
couple at this day.”</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne looked at the excited face of Gilardoni
in a strange, contemplative silence for a moment or two,
as the Italian paused. The dark, foreign face was lividly
pale from passion; the dark, gleaming eyes were burning
with inward fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>“I thought you assured me just this moment,” observed
the young officer, “that Lucia Guiscardini had not jilted
you. If you loved her, and she declared she reciprocated
your affection, why, it is to be imagined that the course
of true love must have run tolerably smooth. A little hypocrisy,
I believe, is supposed to be pardonable with the
feminine part of our common humanity. If she said she
loved you, her affection was next best to reality.”</p>

<p>“She declared she loved me. I believed her,” said
Gilardoni fiercely. “I believed her because—I supposed
because I wished it to be true. I fancied no man was
ever so happy as I. For a while I walked no longer on
earth, but on roseate clouds of happiness. I despise myself
when I look back on that time. Perhaps I am not the
first who has been betrayed into folly by the arts and
wiles of a beautiful, treacherous girl,” the Italian added,
shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>“You have not yet given me the slightest idea of the
reason why you so cordially dislike Madam Guiscardini,
if that be her correct designation,” said Captain Desfrayne.
“You indulge in the most vehement invectives
against her, yet state no specific charge. You say you
made a fool of yourself about her, and that she laughed
in her sleeve at your declarations of affection. Certainly,
very shabby on her part, but, then, it is a thing beautiful,
vain, silly women do every day. Why should you cherish
such rancor against her? I suppose she found she could
make a better market of her beauty and wonderful talents
than by disposing of them to a man who could never
hope to raise her beyond the level of, say, a wealthy
farmer’s wife. Do not be too severe upon her.”</p>

<p>“If she had laughed at me, and left me,” cried Gilardoni,
throwing out his hands with impetuosity, “I could
have forgiven her; I might have forgotten her. It could
not have been that I could ever have loved again; but
what of that? I do not believe in love <i>now</i>. But no.
She left the poison of her treacherous touch upon my life.
I could kill her, if she were within my reach.”</p>

<p>“Such hate must be justified by very serious provocation,”
said Paul Desfrayne. “May I ask how your love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
was turned to such bitter gall, since your suit prospered
in the first instance?”</p>

<p>“By deeds of the blackest treachery.”</p>

<p>“In a word, may I ask—since we are playing at the
game of question and answer—may I once more ask,
why do you hate the beautiful Lucia Guiscardini? She
did not jilt you, you say—then what relationship does
she hold toward you?”</p>

<p>Gilardoni turned his great dark eyes upon his master,
as if in surprise, forgetting at the moment that he had
not told him of the completing point of his story. Then
he said, with a vindictive bitterness terrible to hear, because
it revealed the smoldering fire beneath:</p>

<p>“She is my wife!”</p>

<p class="center">LEONARDO GILARDONI’S STORY.</p>


<p>Had the earth yawned suddenly open at his feet, Paul
Desfrayne could not have expressed more utter amazement
than was depicted in his face and in his entire attitude
on hearing the declaration made by Leonardo
Gilardoni. He stared as if confounded.</p>

<p>“Your wife!” he repeated, at length.</p>

<p>“Certainly. My wife,” answered the valet.</p>

<p>“Then—then——Great heavens, your <i>wife</i>! But it
is impossible.”</p>

<p>“Why should it be impossible?” almost angrily demanded
the Italian. “Do you mean it is impossible that
the famous star of the lyrical stage should be the wife
of a poor, penniless fellow like myself? It must seem
strange—I don’t deny it. But in her early days she was
one of the poorest and most obscure of peasant girls, and
thought Leonardo Gilardoni, with his little piece of land,
and the savings bequeathed by his father, quite a catch.
No thought of English milords and Russian princes
then.”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne took a hasty turn or two, then again
faced his servant.</p>

<p>“You amaze me,” he said. “Then how did it happen,
since you loved her, as you say, that you came to be separated
from her, and how has it come about that you appear
to be utter strangers, you two? How is it that she
contemplates—if report speak true—marriage with a
Russian prince, if she is already married, the wife of
Leonardo Gilardoni?”</p>

<p>But as he spoke, Paul Desfrayne was thinking, with
a half-dazed brain, that if Lucia Guiscardini should prove
to be the wife of this Italian servant, her marriage with
himself must have been perfectly illegal.</p>

<p>If she were the wife of another, why, he must be
free. But it could not be. He had yet to hear some explanation
which would inevitably shut out from view the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
bright vision of happy freedom conjured up for a moment
by the wild words of Gilardoni.</p>

<p>No; it was beyond hope that this poisonous sting could
ever be taken from out his blighted life.</p>

<p>The lovely, pure face of Lois Turquand, as he had seen
it on the terrace in the dim, dreamy light, rose before him,
as if to reproach him for a wrong unconsciously wrought
against her by his fatal marriage.</p>

<p>It was evident Gilardoni knew nothing whatever of <i>la</i>
Lucia’s marriage with Paul Desfrayne.</p>

<p>The Italian was watching his master’s countenance as
if anxious to discover the current of his thoughts. There
was a momentary pause. Then Gilardoni said, less excitedly:</p>

<p>“Why does she think of bettering her condition by a
splendid marriage with a great noble when she is the wife
of a poor serving-man like myself? Simply because she
has destroyed the evidence of her unlucky first marriage.”</p>

<p>In spite of his better sense, a sharp spasm of disappointment
seized the heart of Paul Desfrayne. He was,
perhaps, worse placed than before. Until now, he had
given Lucia Guiscardini credit for being what she really
represented herself to be, and had imagined that balked
ambition rather than absolute wickedness had led to her
vile deception and iniquitous treachery toward himself.
She had seemed a wild, undisciplined creature, ignorant
of the world and its ways, cold and reserved except on a
few occasions when she had permitted him to snatch
feverish kisses from her lips, and press her in his arms.
But now, if Gilardoni’s accusations were true, she was
a crafty, evil, unscrupulous woman, who had crushed an
innocent man with the hope to step up into wealth and
power.</p>

<p>She was the wife of this servant, yet at any moment,
did she so will, she could claim to stand by the side of
Captain Paul Desfrayne, whose legal wife she was, until
proof of a prior marriage could be obtained. Wife of
Paul Desfrayne, so proud of his untarnished family name
and descent, so adoringly fond of his mother, whose besetting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
sin was family pride and love of the world’s
homage.</p>

<p>“Destroyed the evidence of her first marriage!” Paul
Desfrayne slowly repeated. “I cannot understand you.”</p>

<p>“Sir, I will tell you the pitiful history. ’Tis not very
long. As children, Lucia and I were playmates. She was
an imperious, overbearing tyrant; but her beauty, her
wiles, her artless ways, as they appeared to be, gained for
her complete dominion over my every thought and action.
I was some six or seven years her senior, and useful to
her—her slave, her jackall.</p>

<p>“She was an orphan, and lived with an old woman,
some distant kind of relation. I lost my parents when
about eighteen or so, and was left my own master. When
Lucia was some ten or eleven years old, I resolved that
she, and none other, should be my wife at some future
day. I told her so many, many times, and she generally
agreed, laughingly. When she was sixteen, I found that
I passionately loved her. Our future marriage had been
a kind of jest until then; but at last I discovered—or
fancied such to be the case—I took it into my head that
I must obtain her love, and make her my wife, or else
my heart must break.</p>

<p>“I can scarcely conceive the wild state of my feelings
<i>now</i> when I look back. I made a serious declaration of
my love the day I gave her this cross; I urged her to
give me her promise, telling her how madly I adored her,
how rich I hoped to be some day by working hard, and
getting and saving money. She knew exactly how much
I was worth. She knew she would have her own way
in everything—she knew how every thought in my brain,
every pulsation of my heart, was given to her.</p>

<p>“I was the best-circumstanced of those she had to
choose from, and I think—I believe—some beam of liking
for me flickered in her cold breast; but I don’t know.
She decided to give me her promise.”</p>

<p>“Which she ratified?” said Paul Desfrayne, as Gilardoni
paused.</p>

<p>“Yes. We were married within a few weeks at the
nearest chapel. Some time before our marriage, Lucia’s
brother who had been brought up in France by his mother’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
uncle, and reared as a priest, had come to take charge
of our spiritual affairs. We were married by him. I
believed there had never been a happier man than myself
when I led the cruel, treacherous girl away from the little
altar.”</p>

<p>“Go on, I beg of you.”</p>

<p>“For some months all went well. Lucia commanded,
and I obeyed. There was but one will in the house—hers;
nothing clashed with it, and so nothing clouded our
happiness. She was very well satisfied; she had fine
clothes, a pretty house, an adoring husband, and triumphed
when she knew she was envied by some of her
girl friends. Then, one day, a famous singer came along.
He was staying in the village—it was his native place,
and he roamed about all day. One morning, he was
walking near our cottage: he heard Lucia singing in the
little rose-garden. I was away at a neighboring town.
He spoke to her—inflamed her ambition by telling her
she had a fortune in her throat. She did not tell him she
was married, or let him see the ring on her finger, and he
told her she might marry an emperor some day if she
pleased.”</p>

<p>“Did she run away with him?” asked Captain Desfrayne.</p>

<p>“She told him she would give him an answer in a week,
after she had consulted with her friends, for he asked
if she would go to Florence with him. When I returned,
she was like one crazy, her eyes all a-glitter with joy
and astonished delight. I instantly told her I would
never hear of her becoming a singer, and going on the
stage. She tried coaxing, storming, threatening, entreaties,
crying, sullenness, all to no purpose. I was inflexible.
During the whole of the week the same scenes
occurred every day, from morning until night—nay, for
the twenty-four hours. The eve of the day when the
signor was to come for his answer found her as resolute
as at first to follow the course pointed out to her by his
selfish hand—found me as doggedly determined to keep
her from destroying her own peace and mine.”</p>

<p>“You did not think you were flinging away a fortune?”
said Paul Desfrayne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“All I thought of was that they asked me to scatter
my happiness to the winds,” replied Gilardoni. “What
did we want with fortune when we had enough for our
needs? The signor came. He must have learned that
this young girl was married, but he made no sign. She
was on the watch for him, and ran to meet him before he
reached the door.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not hinder them from speaking?”</p>

<p>“Pooh! Unless I could have locked her up in a cell,
it would have been utterly impossible to prevent her from
communicating with him. She did not call me, but let
him depart. Then she came in and told me that he had
renewed his golden promises, that she had informed him
her friends objected to her becoming a stage singer, but
that she hoped to gain consent, and had requested him to
return in three or four days. He was resolved not to lose
sight of her, and waited patiently. She tried again to
shake my determination, but in vain.</p>

<p>“I then thought of applying to her brother, the priest,
for help in combatting her fatal desires and intentions,
but he had consented to go to America as a missionary,
and was at that time away making some final arrangements—partly
settling who should succeed him in his
humble cure. In a fortnight more he was to begin his
journey. Lucia nearly drove me frantic; but a day or
two before that fixed for the final decision, she suddenly
became strangely calm and quiet, with the horrible tranquillity
of a wild beast which crouches to take its spring
upon a victim.”</p>

<p>All these explanations were necessary to render poor
Gilardoni’s story intelligible; but the suspense until he
should arrive at the conclusive point in his recital was almost
sickening to his hearer, for whom the facts possessed
an absorbing interest, undreamed of by the narrator.</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne did not utter a word when Gilardoni
paused for a moment.</p>

<p>“Lucia had made up her mind,” the valet continued,
“to close with the alluring offers of the stranger. How
do you think she contrived to get rid of the impediments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
caused by my stern obstinacy, as she considered the opposition
I raised?”</p>

<p>“How can I tell?”</p>

<p>“She made one or two faint efforts to move me that
last day; then she drugged some wine I was to drink in
the evening. Having secured a fair start, she went off
with the crabbed old man who had thus torn her from
the home she had made so happy for a few short months.”</p>

<p>“Did she leave any clue to the place she was bound
for?”</p>

<p>“None. A few lines scrawled on a bit of torn paper
told me why she had gone, and with whom. I found
this paper the next morning when I roused myself from
my deathlike sleep. The drug left me weak in body and
mind; some days elapsed before I could gain sufficient
strength to form any plan. Then I made some careful
inquiries, for I wished to avoid being talked about and
laughed at by the scandal-loving old women of the village.
I found that there was a probability of finding my
wife and her new music-master at Turin.”</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne shuddered. The name of these beautiful
Italian cities always brought back feelings of pain and
bitterness to his memory.</p>

<p>“I traveled day and night,” Gilardoni went on. “Such
little property as I had I sold, realizing a moderate sum
of money, for I needed resources in my pursuit, and
knew that the pretty, happy nest could never be the same
to me again. My information, gleaned grain by grain,
proved correct. She was at Turin. Step by step, slowly,
laboriously, with the patience of an Indian, I tracked her
out.</p>

<p>“My ardent love was then undergoing a change, and
I felt deep anger against her for her utter indifference
to me, for her rank defiance of my wishes, of my lawful
authority. I discovered her living in an obscure suburb
with an old attendant. Every stratagem I used to obtain
an interview with her failed. I tried to bribe the old
servant, or duenna, or governess, and she first flung my
money contemptuously in my face, and then banged the
gates. I wrote, but could not tell whether my letters
reached the cruel hands of my treacherous wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“I watched the doors of her house, but in vain, for I
afterward found that she rarely quitted the house, and
then by a small gate at the end of the large garden, which
led into a sheltered lane little frequented. Her singing-master
entered by this gate, and as I was ignorant that
there was any way of obtaining admittance except by the
iron gates in the front of the house, I was baffled in my
object of waylaying and questioning him. By dint of
inquiring ceaselessly, I found out where he lived, and one
day I went to his house, and confronted him.”</p>

<p>“And the result?”</p>

<p>“I demanded of him my wife—he laughed at me and
my reproaches, entreaties, and threats. At last he menaced
me—said that if I again annoyed him he would
hand me over to the authorities as a dangerous lunatic.
He professed to know nothing of the person I asked for.
In spite of my fury, I had the sense to think that perhaps
my wife had given him a name other than her own or
mine. I endeavored to reasonably explain the circumstances
of her flight. He sneered at me for an idiot, or
an impostor, and coolly showed me the door. I thank
Heaven I did not slay him in my frenzy and despair.”</p>

<p>“Then did you ever see the woman—your wife—again?”</p>

<p>“By accident, I discovered the existence of the little
gate at the back of the house. I was passing down the
shaded lane, and noticed the gate open. The idea of its
belonging to the house where my wife was staying did
not occur to me at the moment. I happened to glance
through, and the wild beauty and luxuriance of the large
garden attracted my eyes. I stood for some minutes inhaling
the delicious odor of the flowers, when I heard a
step, and the rustle of feminine garments.</p>

<p>“An instant more, and I saw—I saw my wife, Lucia,
pacing slowly along the path, her skirts trailing over the
mingled flowers and weeds of the flower-borders, her
eyes cast down, her arms hanging by her side, looking
weary, and, I fancied, sad. I stood still, spellbound, as if
unable to move a step. For a second my heart melted;
the mad love I cherished rose in all its old intensity. I
flattered myself that perhaps she regretted her precipitation—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
induced myself to imagine that she was to a
great extent influenced by the mercenary old dog who
had lured her away. The idea that she might welcome
me with a cry of gladness, and throw herself into my
arms with tears of penitence, unnerved me.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“She drew nearer and nearer, unconscious of my presence,
the shrubs that grew about the door, or gate, serving
to conceal me. As she came close, when I could almost
have touched her, she happened to raise her eyes.
She uttered one cry—a cry of fear, or surprise, or both,
and then stood perfectly still, as if turned to stone. I
sprang toward her with one long stride, and caught her
by the arm, afraid that even now she might elude me.</p>

<p>“I do not remember what either said—it was a repetition
of what had passed before. But I do remember that
when I said I would compel her to obey me, as my wife,
and told her she could enter into no contract without my
consent, she stared at me, and broke into contemptuous
laughter—laughter of defiance. She answered that she
was no wife of mine, and acknowledged the authority of
no one save her nearest relative, her brother, the priest.</p>

<p>“For a moment I really thought her brain was turned.
I asked her if she could deny that her brother had joined
our hands in the little chapel of our native village. She
declared I was uttering rank falsehood, or impertinent
folly. I swore I would soon prove our marriage, and
bring witnesses by the dozen. She laughed again, and
said I was welcome to indulge in my own fancies, unless
they annoyed her.”</p>

<p>“You said she had destroyed the evidence of the marriage,”
said Captain Desfrayne, fixing his eyes on Gilardoni,
as if to read his very soul.</p>

<p>“Thunderstruck, confounded, I knew not what to say.
I thought it was a ruse to get me to leave the garden,
for perhaps she feared I might enter the house, and then
be difficult to dislodge. So I no longer thought she had
lost her senses, but that she was trying to do by cunning
what she could not hope to effect by force or persuasion.
But in the end she had her own way. It was of no earthly
use arguing with her, or threatening: she was immovable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
and answered every sentence I addressed to her by
the same firm iteration of the fact that she was no wife
of mine.</p>

<p>“She laughed insultingly when I said the law would
speedily decide between us. Perhaps she knew it was
an idle threat of mine, for what could the law do to bring
again to my arms the woman I had deluded myself into
imagining loved me? I was unable to guess what she
meant by so boldly denying she had been married to me.
In brief, I left her. I lost no time, but hurried back to
obtain proof of my marriage.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A VISION OF FREEDOM.</p>


<p>“On my return to our native village, after an absence
of some two months,” continued Gilardoni, “I found that
the priest, Lucia’s brother, had departed. His successor—a
stranger—received me very kindly; but when I revealed
to him my painful situation, and asked his advice,
he looked perfectly distressed. When I begged him to
let me have a copy of the register of my marriage, he
told me, with much agitation, that the book had been
stolen.”</p>

<p>“Stolen!—by her?” exclaimed Paul Desfrayne.</p>

<p>“Without a doubt,” replied Gilardoni. “He had not
arrived at the time it was purloined. I believe that the
night Lucia fled from my home she gained access to the
chapel, taking the keys from her brother’s room. It was
not until the eve of his departure that he knew anything
of the loss, for there had not been any occasion to use the
book during those last weeks.”</p>

<p>“She had taken this daring means to free herself from
your authority, or the legal control you might have exercised
over her?” said Paul Desfrayne. “Had she, think
you, destroyed the book?”</p>

<p>He made the inquiry with a flutter at his heart.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” answered Gilardoni. “It is impossible
she would have had the folly to preserve it. The probability—the
certainty is, that she burned it.”</p>

<p>“What infamy—what wickedness!” cried Paul Desfrayne.</p>

<p>Gilardoni shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Her insatiate ambition, her craving for wealth, station,
luxury, overmastered all other feelings,” he said.</p>

<p>“Then she was free to defy you and all the world?”</p>

<p>“Quite so.”</p>

<p>“What did you do on making this extraordinary discovery?”</p>

<p>“What could I do? No inquiries could enable me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
glean the slightest clue to the place whither her brother,
the priest, had gone. I sought in every direction my limited
resources admitted of for information as to his
whereabouts, but, beyond the fact that he had gone to
America, could learn nothing.”</p>

<p>“America? What part of America?”</p>

<p>“I could not ascertain. Some place in South America.
Afterward, when I began to move about more freely, I
might perhaps have obtained the name of his location, but
by that time I had lost all desire of even seeing or hearing
of the treacherous woman I had made my wife. I
said to myself, even if I succeeded in proving the legality
of my union with her, of what avail would it be? She
would never return to me: even if she did, she would be
like another creature, not the Lucia I had loved—the
pretty, innocent girl I fancied loved me.”</p>

<p>“Did you see her again?”</p>

<p>“I made no attempt to do so. I wrote a few lines, bitterly
reproaching her for the crime she had committed—the
double crime. Of that brief letter she took no notice
whatever. She continued, I believe, to study with the
Signor Ballarini, until fitted to appear on the stage. I
do not know what agreement she made with him; the only
thing I know is that she came out under her own name,
not, thanks be to Providence, under mine!”</p>

<p>“And then she attained her desire of becoming a star
of the first magnitude,” said Captain Desfrayne, as Gilardoni
paused. “She gained the wealth, luxury, power,
all but the rank she yearned for. Did you ever see her
after that day you came on her by accident in the garden
at Turin?”</p>

<p>“I have at rare intervals happened to catch a glimpse
of her, without desiring to see her, driving past in her
carriage, perhaps,” replied Gilardoni. “Not even once
have I had the curiosity to enter the theater when she has
been singing; the screech of some arch fiend would have
been as pleasing in my ears as her finest notes. Not once
have I felt an inclination to ask a question as to her way
of life.</p>

<p>“People have told me that she is one of the best of
women, noted for her charity and goodness. They little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
knew that he to whom they spoke had the first right to be
considered in her schemes of benevolence. I took no
care of my little money, already diminished by my
searches after her unworthy self, and after her brother.</p>

<p>“The consequence was, I soon became reduced almost
to the verge of want. The good priest who had succeeded
the Padre Josef, my brother-in-law, obtained for
me a situation as servant to a nobleman—the Count Di
Venosta—with whom I was when I first saw you, sir.
My life flowed in a dull current until his death; after
that, illness, poverty, misery, despair, until these last few
days, when I had the good fortune to meet with you,
and you had compassion on my friendless state.”</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne considered for some moments.
Should he reveal his painful secret to this man who had
been so frank with him? He could not resolve to do so:
the humiliation would be too great. Before he had felt
his situation most painful. These revelations rendered it
well-nigh insupportable.</p>

<p>That Madam Guiscardini should have the daring to
plan the theft of the marriage-register, and the nerve,
the cool audacity, to carry her plot into execution, and
then refrain from the destruction of the proof she desired
to keep from all men’s eyes, was incredible. Yet a
strange thought occurred to him.</p>

<p>“If no proof of her marriage with you exists,” he said
to the Italian, “how do you account for the fact that she
evidently fears to accept any of the brilliant offers they
say she has received?”</p>

<p>“Very easily,” answered Leonardo, with a savage
grimace. “Although the book is, or may be, no longer
in existence, her brother may be found any day, and he
could prove her marriage. I do not care to seek him, and
if I did, my poverty restrains me. But she probably
knows well that if she dared to marry any of these infatuated
nobles, who are ready to throw their coronets at
her feet, I should stand forth and denounce her. If I
declare her to be my wife, she must disprove my words.
I, in my poverty, can do nothing; but a rich man—such
as she would desire to wed—could seek for the man who
could seal my words as truth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>A thrill of hope ran through the heart of his hearer.
For a moment the impulse to tell him the bitter facts
of his own share in Lucia’s miserable history almost overmastered
Paul Desfrayne’s prudence. But he resolved to
make no sign until he had consulted Frank Amberley, to
whom he looked now as his chief friend and adviser in
his present difficulties. If he could get leave of absence,
he meant to go to London for some hours the next day,
in order to see the young lawyer.</p>

<p>“Perhaps her brother is dead,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” assented the other. “But she would feel
secure if such were the case, and we should soon hear of
her as princess, duchess, or some such exalted personage.”</p>

<p>“He might die, and make no sign. Missionary priests
are sometimes slain in obscure places, or die of hunger
on toilsome journeys, and are never heard of more,” Captain
Desfrayne said.</p>

<p>He knew full well that it was in reality her luckless
marriage with himself that fixed the bar.</p>

<p>“Sir,” Leonardo said, “I think I have earned the right
to ask how this cross—my first gift to her—came from
her hands into your possession.”</p>

<p>This was a home-thrust.</p>

<p>“She fancied I was the rich milord who might one day
place a coronet on her brow,” said Paul Desfrayne, very
slowly. “I was one of her most ardent admirers at Florence.”</p>

<p>“I understand.”</p>

<p>“Afterward—some time later—she discovered that I
was—that I was not the wealthy nobleman she had imagined
me to be,” half-stammered Gilardoni’s master.</p>

<p>“That was enough. I comprehend. That was quite
enough for her. But if she wished to entrap you, she
would have dared to consent to marry you.”</p>

<p>“My good fellow, I wish to get to my room,” said
the young officer, who felt sick at heart, although a faint
gleam of hope had come to him. “It is almost break of
dawn.”</p>

<p>These last words struck him with a singular sense of
being familiar, as if he had uttered them in some previous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
stage of existence, or had heard some one speak
them at some startling crisis.</p>

<p>“You must be tired out, sir.”</p>

<p>Gilardoni pushed the little cross toward his master
without making any remark about it.</p>

<p>“I don’t want the thing, Gilardoni,” said Paul Desfrayne,
with a half-contemptuous sigh. “It is yours of
right, I doubt not. It can have no value for me. I do
not know why I have preserved it.”</p>

<p>He took up the taper which his valet had lighted, and
went into his bedroom, saying he had no need of further
service from Gilardoni.</p>

<p>Then he closed and locked the door, and sat down on
the edge of his bed, to consider his position.</p>

<p>A thousand distracting thoughts ran through his brain,
but above all dominated the one idea that he must, at
any hazard, try to find out if the Padre Josef were alive
or dead. If alive, he could loose these agonizing bonds
that were cutting his life-strings. If dead——</p>

<p>If dead, then no hope remained.</p>

<p>At all events, the first step would be to see Frank Amberley.</p>

<p>What if he essayed another interview with Lucia Guiscardini,
and, armed with his present knowledge, sought to
extort some kind of confession from her? Should he endeavor
to make her tell whether she knew, or did not
know, if her brother yet lived?</p>

<p>With his unhappy experience of her obstinate and violent
temper, he could scarcely hope for any good result
from seeing her. He had no power or influence over
her, could offer no inducement of any kind to persuade
her to admit anything. Too well he knew beforehand
that she would flatly deny her marriage with Leonardo
Gilardoni—would probably deny that she had now or
ever had had a brother at all. She would either laugh
in his face, or storm with rage, as the humor suited her.</p>

<p>To seek out the priest would demand an immense outlay,
and if, after all, the search should prove unavailing,
or he should be dead, then he, Paul Desfrayne, would be
left penniless, and possibly heavily in debt.</p>

<p>Would it be well to send Gilardoni on the quest? No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
one would seek as he should. Each little trifle that might
escape others, however hawk-eyed, would be sure clues
to his eager, vengeful glance.</p>

<p>“I will decide nothing now,” he at last thought. “I
will be entirely guided by Frank Amberley’s advice. He
will be able to judge what is best, and, if the search is
advisable, will be capable of estimating the probable expenses.
My liberty alone would be worth ten years of
my life.”</p>

<p>For a moment the vision of what might be if his freedom
were secured presented itself before his mind, but
he dared not indulge in the dangerous contemplation of
such a joy, and sank into troubled slumbers as the first
rays of the morning sun penetrated into the chamber.</p>

<p>His face looked worn and weary in the fresh morning
beams, as it rested on his arm.</p>

<p>The heart of his fond mother must have been melted
with love and pity had she gazed on the distressed face,
and noted the restless tossing of the wearied body, to
which sleep seemed to bring no refreshment.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The day came in its inevitable course.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree and Lois made sure that they would
see Captain Desfrayne during the afternoon. Ordinary
etiquette, if no other feeling, must bring him to inquire
how the young ladies fared after their fright.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree did not attempt to induce Lois to confide
in her. Lois, on her side, did not volunteer any remark
beyond a very few dry commonplaces regarding
the rescue of herself and Blanche Dormer from their
perilous situation. The young girl made no sign whereby
Lady Quaintree could judge of the state of her feelings.</p>

<p>Both were prepared to wait with a kind of painful uncertainty
for Captain Desfrayne’s coming. Each wished,
for different reasons, that this journey had never been
undertaken.</p>

<p>Had any rational excuse been at hand, each would have
urged an immediate return to London.</p>

<p>The question was settled very unexpectedly. As the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
three ladies rose from breakfast, a servant came in very
hurriedly, the bearer of a telegram directed to Lady
Quaintree.</p>

<p>Her ladyship’s hand trembled slightly as she took the
paper from the salver, and she hesitated for a moment
before breaking the envelope.</p>

<p>Telegrams, when unexpected, are always more or less
alarming, and Lady Quaintree could not think of any
possible good reason why any one should address one
to her. She took it out, however, and, putting on her
gold-rimmed spectacles, read the curt sentences:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Return as soon as possible. My father ill, though not
seriously so. He wishes for you. A train leaves Holston
at 12:15; the next at 2:45.”</p>
</div>

<p>It was from her son Gerald.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree gave the telegram to the two girls,
while she inquired if the messenger was still in waiting.</p>

<p>The youth who had come from the railway-station
was called into the room. Lois wrote an answer from
Lady Quaintree’s dictation to the effect that they would
start by the 12:15 train, and this was sent by the same
messenger who had brought the telegram.</p>

<p>As the visit was simply a flying one, little preparation
had been made, and the ladies’ luggage was of the most
portable description; so Justine, who was hastily summoned,
had nothing to do in the shape of packing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ormsby was sent for, and came in dignified
haste.</p>

<p>“We are obliged to leave a day sooner than we had
arranged for, Mrs. Ormsby,” said Lady Quaintree. “Miss
Turquand is not sure of what time she may return, and
it may be a long period before I come again. But we are
both well pleased with the order and arrangement of everything
in the establishment under your control.”</p>

<p>The housekeeper curtsied to imply her thanks and
gratification. Her ladyship requested that the carriage
might be ready at once, as they left by the 12:15 train
for London.</p>

<p>A council of war was held as to the desirability of
Blanche’s accompanying them. No time remained for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
consulting her parents, so at length Lady Quaintree settled
that she should go with them.</p>

<p>“Even if my lord should prove more unwell than my
son admits,” she said, “you will be a great comfort to me
and to our dear Lois; and if you should find my house
irksome under the circumstances, I can easily locate you
with any one of half a dozen friends, who would be delighted
to receive you, my love.”</p>

<p>The three were soon equipped for their journey. As
the day was soft and warm, almost threatening to be
sultry and overcoming, the completion of their toilets
consisted in donning country straw hats, dainty lace
capes, and gloves. Lady Quaintree folded a soft white
shawl of fine silky wool about her, and they descended
to the carriage, having hurriedly partaken of luncheon
prepared by Mrs. Ormsby.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THE EXPRESS TO LONDON.</p>


<p>“What messages are we to leave for Captain Desfrayne,
my dear?” asked Lady Quaintree of Lois.</p>

<p>They had both left his name to the last, each loath to
be the one to recall it.</p>

<p>Her ladyship noted, while apparently trying to master
a refractory button on her glove, that the rose tint on
Lois’ cheeks deepened, and then flowed over the rest of
her face, while the long, dark lashes drooped.</p>

<p>“Dear madam,” said the young girl, “that is a question
I should rather have asked you, who know so much
better than I do the proper things to be said.”</p>

<p>“Proper, my love,” repeated the old lady, smiling.
“It is not a matter of saying ‘proper’ or ‘civil’ things.
What do you wish to say?”</p>

<p>The color faded from Lois’ face, and then flowed back
again in a roseate glow.</p>

<p>“I am sure Miss Dormer and I are both most grateful
to Captain Desfrayne for his kindness——” began
Lois.</p>

<p>Blanche put her hands on Lois’ waist, and gave her
a gentle shake, and a glance of reproach.</p>

<p>“‘Miss Dormer!’ You unkind Lois!” she said. “I
thought I had asked you to call me Blanche.”</p>

<p>Lois felt as if she must say things worthy of smiling
rebuke, whether she willed it or not.</p>

<p>“Come, we must leave some message, in case the captain
should happen to call,” said Lady Quaintree.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ormsby,” she continued, turning to the housekeeper,
who was following to attend them to their carriage,
“if Captain Desfrayne—the gentleman who dined
here yesterday—should come during the day, will you be
good enough to inform him that we were unexpectedly
summoned to London on the most urgent affairs?”</p>

<p>“I will do so, my lady,” replied Mrs. Ormsby.</p>

<p>The carriage drove off, containing the three ladies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
Justine and the one or two other servants immediately
attending them. There was no time to send for Blanche’s
maid; but it was agreed that she should be sent for at
once on their arrival at Lowndes Square.</p>

<p>Lois gazed at the stately Hall and its lovely grounds,
with strange, mingled feelings, as the carriage bore her
swiftly away. An uncomfortable sensation rose in her
throat, as if tears of regret were stealing from their hiding-place,
as she reflected that she was in all likelihood
losing a chance of seeing Paul Desfrayne, and hearing his
promised explanation.</p>

<p>“He will come to-day; and I shall not be here,” she
thought.</p>

<p>His face and form haunted her, try as she would to
banish the recollection. A dangerous longing, inexplicable
to herself, rose in her heart, just to see him once
more. A wicked longing, she knew, if he belonged to
another. And the impediment which hindered him from
addressing her was evidently an insuperable one. His
words, although mystifying, left no doubt.</p>

<p>“I wish I had never seen or heard of him,” she said
to herself. “Yet why should I let myself think of him
in this foolish, weak way. My pride, if nothing else,
should forbid my wishing even to see him. It is enough
that he has assured me he can never think of me. Why
do I think about him, except as a harassing care forced
on me? I have known him but a few days; he is a
stranger, an absolute stranger to me, and yet I continue
to brood over his words, and my resentment against
him seems gone.”</p>

<p>The drive to the station was even pleasanter than the
drive of the day before. As yet the day was tolerably
cool, and snow-white clouds flecked a sky of purest blue.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree was not sorry to be rid of the handsome
claimant to her protégée’s hand, heart, and desirable
fortune, if it were only for a while. She could not,
for all her maternal pride, be blind to the fact that Paul
Desfrayne would be a formidable rival to her Gerald, unless
the latter could secure a very firm interest in the affections
of the young lady who might be addressed by
both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>A polite guard chose a convenient compartment for the
ladies. A smile, a hasty uplifting of the finger to his cap
as Lady Quaintree’s delicate pearl-gray glove approached
his brown palm, and then he closed the door respectfully.</p>

<p>But at the last moment, and just as the guard blew his
whistle, a gentleman came rushing on the platform.</p>

<p>“Going by the express, sir? Here you are, sir—here
you are. Not a minute to be lost,” cried the guard.</p>

<p>The good fellow had intended that the ladies should
have their compartment all to themselves; but he had no
time to move from the spot where he stood. The train
began to draw its snakelike body to move out from the
station. He threw open the door, and the gentleman
sprang lightly on the step, steadied himself for an instant,
and then entered.</p>

<p>The three ladies turned their gaze simultaneously on
their fellow passengers, and the same exclamation escaped
their lips at the same moment:</p>

<p>“Captain Desfrayne!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Truly, Captain Desfrayne on his way to London to
consult Frank Amberley. He recognized the ladies as
he balanced himself on the step of the carriage.</p>

<p>Had it been possible, he would have drawn back, and
gone anywhere rather than continue this journey in Lois’
company. For a second his eyes met hers. New hope,
clouded by pain and uncertainty, beamed in his; fear,
timid reproach, inquiry, doubt, glanced from hers.</p>

<p>Blanche could not help exchanging a look of amazement
with Lois, nor could it escape her notice that the
telltale crimson mounted to Miss Turquand’s cheeks,
just now so pale.</p>

<p>“Captain Desfrayne! An unexpected pleasure,” said
Lady Quaintree, extending her hand, though secretly ill
pleased.</p>

<p>“Quite so,” answered Captain Desfrayne, himself anything
but delighted. “I had not the most distant idea
you and Miss Turquand intended to quit Flore Hall so
soon.”</p>

<p>He could not hinder his eyes from wandering to Lois’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
face. The young girl, filled with anger at his inconsistent
conduct, averted her head, and gazed from the
window. When she stole a glance at him again, he was
looking from the window on his side, his face clouded
by the care and trouble that seemed rarely absent.</p>

<p>Nobody said much during the journey; for subjects of
conversation were not readily found, and even Blanche
had abundant matter for mental consideration.</p>

<p>To Lois and Paul Desfrayne, it seemed like a dream
more than reality.</p>

<p>The thickly clustered houses, the red-tiled roofs and
chimney-pots began to give intimation that they were
nearing London.</p>

<p>“We may not hope, then, to see much of you this
week, at any rate?” Lady Quaintree observed, shaking
herself out of a brief slumber.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“I must go back to Holston as soon as I can,” he replied.</p>

<p>The express slackened speed, and at last rolled into
the terminus.</p>

<p>Gerald was waiting for his mother on the platform.
He assisted her from the carriage, leaving the care of
the two young girls to Captain Desfrayne.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree eagerly paused to make anxious inquiries
about her husband. She had moved on a few
steps, and Captain Desfrayne felt he must offer some
kind of excuse to Lois for not affording her the clue to
his mysterious behavior he had promised. He laid a
tremulous hand on her wrist, and drew her some steps
away from her friend.</p>

<p>“Miss Turquand,” he said eagerly, looking her full
in the face, a deeply troubled, excited expression in his
eyes, “I must entreat of you not to judge me harshly,
but with mercy and kindness. I merit all your pity. I am
a most unhappy man. It would have been well if I could
have explained my position last night, as I meant to do;
but this is no time or place to end the conversation then
begun and interrupted. May I beseech you to suspend
your judgment until I have been able to tell you how
I am circumstanced?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“I have no right to judge you,” said Lois coldly. “If
you are unhappy, you have my pity.”</p>

<p>She felt piqued that he fixed no time for giving her the
promised explanation. He left her still mystified.</p>

<p>“Will you give me your promise not to condemn me
until you have heard my story?” urged Paul Desfrayne.</p>

<p>“I repeat, I have no right to judge you,” said Lois.
“Those who have the care of me and my affairs have the
best right to hear what you have to say.”</p>

<p>If her words sounded cold and repelling to her hearer,
they were yet more so to herself. She felt that she spoke
harshly, and with scarcely veiled bitterness, and, as she
saw the young man droop his head, she hastily added,
with a softened tone:</p>

<p>“Your language, sir, is strange and perplexing to me.
You allude to some unhappy circumstances, of which, as
you say, I am entirely ignorant. If you see fit to explain
these circumstances to me, I think you may count on my
sympathy. If you do not deem it necessary that I should
be further acquainted with them, let it be forgotten that
you have ever touched on them at all.”</p>

<p>The young girl, faint and agitated from contending
feelings, put out her hands like one who does not see
her way clearly. Blanche, who had drawn back, stepped
hastily to her side, and gave her an arm to lean upon.</p>

<p>“My poor darling!” whispered Blanche tenderly.</p>

<p>The sympathetic accents vibrated on Lois’ heart like an
electric shock. She roused herself from the momentary
weakness to which she had yielded, and extended her
hand to Captain Desfrayne.</p>

<p>“Adieu, sir,” she said.</p>

<p>The young man caught her hand, and involuntarily
pressed the slender fingers within his own. He gazed
for an instant into the dreamy eyes, so pure, so frank, so
truthful, so trusting, then, loosing the little hand, turned
away with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>As he did so, Lady Quaintree looked back, and made a
signal to the girls to accompany her to the carriage,
which was in waiting. She smiled in her own gracious
way upon the young officer, though she really wished him
at Jericho.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>He advanced, and lifted his hat.</p>

<p>“I presume, madam, I can be of no service to you?” he
said, glancing for a moment at the Honorable Gerald,
who was unknown to him.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree, remembering that the young men
were strangers to each other, introduced them.</p>

<p>“If you should happen to make a longer stay in town
than you count on,” she said, “we shall be very pleased
to see you, either this evening, or to-morrow, or at any
time it may suit you to come. I find my lord’s illness is
not of so serious a nature as at first appeared.”</p>

<p>An interchange of civil smiles, a shake or two of the
hand, some polite valedictory salutations, and the brief
whirling scene was over—past as a dream.</p>

<p>“I think I was right,” murmured Blanche, in her
friend’s ear, as they drove off in Lady Quaintree’s luxurious
carriage.</p>

<p>Lois tightly pressed the hand that tenderly sought her
own; but did not meet Blanche’s eye, which she feared
for the moment.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne threw himself into a hansom.</p>

<p>“Alderman’s Lane,” he cried to the driver.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">FRANK AMBERLEY’S ADVICE.</p>


<p>Captain Desfrayne was at first so eager and vehement,
that Frank Amberley found it a little difficult to disentangle
the strange story he had to tell.</p>

<p>The young lawyer did not find himself in an agreeable
position. In the secret depths of his heart he would have
infinitely preferred that Paul Desfrayne should remain
bound. So long as his marriage was an unalterable fact,
there was no fear of his carrying off Lois. There was
scant hope for Frank himself, poor fellow; but he was
asked to give his best aid toward demolishing the great
bar to her union with this powerful rival. If she did not
care for any one else—and he reflected with a sigh that
she cared little for himself—the probability was that she
would not raise any urgent objections toward fulfilling
her dead benefactor’s wishes.</p>

<p>But he was generous, and scorned to act a mean and
dishonorable part. The cloud was dissipated from his
grave, kind face by a sad smile, and he said:</p>

<p>“You wish to ask my advice and assistance how to proceed?”</p>

<p>“I shall be most thankful if you will give me your
opinion as to how I ought to act,” answered his visitor.</p>

<p>“Is there any chance of your being able to compel this—your—Madam
Guiscardini to confess whether she has
or has not destroyed the stolen register?”</p>

<p>“None that I can see. She is of a most stubborn nature.
Even if there were no particular object to be
gained, I believe she would obstinately refuse to do or
say anything that did not suit or please her.”</p>

<p>“I am sincerely sorry for your cruel situation,” said
Frank Amberley, in a tone of profound feeling.</p>

<p>“Of that I am assured,” replied Paul Desfrayne; “and
I come to you in the full confidence that you will help
me to the utmost of your power.”</p>

<p>“The register being, we will say, destroyed, there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
resource but to trace out the priest who married Lucia
to her peasant lover?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“But the expense would be something frightful. There
would probably be a great delay, and in the end perhaps
the man might not be discovered.”</p>

<p>“Could you form any idea of what the search might
cost?”</p>

<p>“It would necessarily depend on the persons employed.
If I understood you aright, you have not trusted your
servant, Gilardoni, with the secret of your own unhappy
marriage?”</p>

<p>“I have not. For one reason, I could not bear to humiliate
myself; for another, I desired to consult you before
moving a step or speaking a word.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will be obliged to take him into your
confidence. He is master of the circumstances; he would
have the strongest motive for tracing out the missing
person. He would probably be more economical and
more devoted than any stranger could be. Send him, and
let him be accompanied by a professional detective. Perhaps
the search may not be such a lengthened one as
you fear.”</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne reflected for a few moments.</p>

<p>“I had already resolved to abide by your advice,” he
said. “Let it be so. I would give all I have in the
world to be free from the consequences of my own mad
folly. When could he set out?”</p>

<p>“As soon as he could make the necessary preparations.
The sooner the better, I should say.”</p>

<p>“What do you think the expenses would be likely to
come to? It would be a bitter disappointment should
the search continue for a certain time, and fail almost
at the last for want of funds.”</p>

<p>“Gilardoni, having traveled a good deal on the Continent,
as I understand you have implied, and being accustomed
to manage for himself and others, would be able
to give you a better estimate than I could form. In his
hands, I don’t think, after all, it would be so very great.
Say ten or fifteen pounds a week. Suppose it took him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
ten months, or even fourteen or eighteen, the calculation
is easy.”</p>

<p>“I will send him to you to-morrow, my dear friend,”
said Paul Desfrayne. “Heaven grant me a happy issue
to this search. But—but the suspense will be something
unbearable.”</p>

<p>“Why, you will constantly hear how the affair is progressing,”
urged Frank Amberley. “Do you think I
could aid you by insisting on an interview with—with
this woman?”</p>

<p>Paul shook his head.</p>

<p>“I fear it would be time wasted,” he answered. “She
would, perhaps, insult and annoy you——”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! Her most violent attack would only make me
laugh, my dear fellow,” interrupted Frank Amberley.
“It would be amusing. In fact, I should really like to
see this lovely tigress in her own den. One doesn’t often
enjoy a chance of interviewing a beautiful fury.”</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne grasped Frank’s hands, and looked
earnestly into those open, candid eyes that yet faithfully
veiled the secret that their owner was a noble, self-sacrificing
hero, offering up a possible gleam of happiness
on the altar of duty. Paul saw nothing but a kind, pleasant,
genial man, who undertook a matter of business
with the genial air of a friend.</p>

<p>“I leave the affair entirely in your care,” he said,
“knowing full well that you will not neglect anything
that may tend to free me from the cruel burden that
weighs me down.”</p>

<p>“You give me permission to speak as fully to this Italian
valet as I may find necessary?” asked Frank Amberley.</p>

<p>He lowered his gaze as he demanded this; his heart
felt heavy and sad, and he feared lest Paul Desfrayne
might read his thoughts.</p>

<p>“Certainly. I give you carte blanche in every way.”</p>

<p>“You do not object to my visiting Madam Guiscardini?”</p>

<p>“I should be rejoiced if you undertook the unpleasant
task, were it only to hear what she has to say. It would
be a very different matter bullying a fellow like Gilardoni,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
and tackling a practised English lawyer like yourself.”</p>

<p>“I should think so. Where is she to be found?”</p>

<p>“When I called at her house on Monday, I was informed
that madam had gone to Paris, and nobody knew
when she would return. On consulting the newspapers,
however, I found she was advertised to appear on Friday
night——”</p>

<p>“To-morrow evening?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I have been told that she prides herself on never
disappointing the public, and that she has never failed
once since her first appearance to perform on the nights
for which she is announced. Her health is excellent, and
she is passionately devoted to her art.”</p>

<p>“Then, if I find she refuses to see me at her house——By
the way, where does she live?”</p>

<p>“She did live in Porchester Square; but may change on
her return, by way of giving a little trouble to those who
may want to see her when it does not suit her to be visited.
But here is the address.”</p>

<p>He scribbled down the number and name of the square
on the back of one of his own cards.</p>

<p>“Have you—did you—that is to say—I mean, has any
explanation passed between you and Miss Turquand?”
inquired Frank Amberley, with some embarrassment.</p>

<p>“I wished to speak to her—to tell her how unhappily
I am situated,” replied Paul Desfrayne hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Did you give her any notion of the nature of this barrier?”
asked Frank Amberley.</p>

<p>“I scarcely know what I said; but I should imagine she
could readily guess to what I must allude. I accidentally
traveled in her company this morning.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Has she returned to London?”</p>

<p>“Lady Quaintree received a telegram stating that her
husband was unwell——”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! Unwell? I must go to Lowndes
Square this evening,” exclaimed Frank, in great concern.
“Do you know what is the matter with him?”</p>

<p>Paul shook his head.</p>

<p>“Lady Quaintree was my informant, and she said that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
the telegram stated simply the fact, without entering
into detail.”</p>

<p>“I will go there directly office-hours are over. In case
I see Miss Turquand, and have any opportunity of speaking
to her, is it still your wish that I should enlighten
her as to the state of your affairs?”</p>

<p>“It is essential that she should not be left in ignorance,”
said Paul. “It is my duty to inform her without
delay, as my silence may be injurious to her.” But he
sighed heavily as he spoke.</p>

<p>“I will use my own discretion,” said Frank Amberley.
“But I could not take any important step without your
special sanction. You will send this Italian valet to
me?”</p>

<p>“At once—early to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“We will set him to work directly he can make his
own personal arrangements. I will make a point of seeing
madam. If I do not succeed in obtaining an interview
with her at her residence, I will endeavor to surprise
her at the opera-house. I think it best to defer engaging
a detective to accompany Gilardoni until I see
him. You will not be able to come up to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“I fear not. Besides, I could not endure to be present
when you inform him of my position.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, what I have to do is, firstly, this evening,
to try to find a chance of enlightening Miss Turquand;
secondly, to-morrow morning, to hold a consultation with
and give instructions to this Leonardo Gilardoni; thirdly,
to-morrow evening, to endeavor to surprise Madam
Guiscardini into some kind of admission, and, if I do not
see her, I must make an opportunity of doing so on Saturday
or Monday, or some time next week. The way is
plain enough. Whether it leads to a happy harbor of
rest remains to be seen.”</p>

<p>“It will be impossible for me ever to thank you sufficiently,”
said Paul Desfrayne.</p>

<p>“Do not speak of that,” replied Frank Amberley. “Are
you obliged to return to your quarters at once?”</p>

<p>“At once; yes.”</p>

<p>The two men clasped hands, and parted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>Lady Quaintree found that her husband’s illness was
not of a seriously alarming nature, but yet sufficiently
grave to justify Gerald in sending for her. The doctor
had ordered the patient to bed; but it was not necessary
for any one to remain with him to watch. Her ladyship,
therefore, with her son and the two young ladies, was at
liberty to dine as usual.</p>

<p>It was not yet the hour fixed for dinner when Frank
Amberley arrived at the house.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gerald went out, sir, and has not come home yet,
though he said he’d be back to dinner,” the domestic
said. “But the young ladies are in the drawing-room.”</p>

<p>The servant threw open the door, announced Mr.
Amberley, and then retired.</p>

<p>Throughout the house the lamps had been lighted, but
were all still turned down to a mere spark; for the long
summer days had only begun to show signs of shortening.
In the drawing-room, a soft, amber glow, subdued
and mellow, mingled its rays with the dreamy semitwilight.</p>

<p>At first, the profound, peaceful silence made Frank
Amberley imagine the apartment was uninhabited; but,
as the door closed, a soft swish of silken garments undeceived
him.</p>

<p>For a moment his heart fluttered with pain and pleasure
at the thought that he was possibly alone with Lois;
but instantly after the unfamiliar figure of Blanche Dormer
presented itself.</p>

<p>She had been reading one of the new magazines,
nestling in a quiet corner by one of the windows.</p>

<p>It was a sufficiently embarrassing situation, as neither
knew what to say. A formal salutation passed, and then
Miss Dormer meditated for a moment or two how she
could best manage to beat a retreat.</p>

<p>Presently, however, these two forgot their embarrassment,
and found themselves chatting together as if they
had been friends for a dozen years.</p>

<p>In about ten minutes Lois appeared, and Blanche did
not then think it necessary to run away. Miss Turquand
was, of course, quite unconscious that Frank Amberley
had any special communication to make, and totally unaware<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
that he took any particular interest in Captain Desfrayne.</p>

<p>When Lady Quaintree came down, she found the
three young people sitting near one of the windows, engaged
in what seemingly was an agreeable and almost
lively conversation. As she stood for a moment at the
door, an odd thought struck her for the first time.</p>

<p>“What a charming wife for Frank Blanchette would
make!” she said to herself.</p>

<p>She pressed Frank to stay to dinner, and he very gladly
accepted her invitation.</p>

<p>Although saddened by the absence of the master of
the house, the little dinner-party was extremely pleasant.
Gerald returned just in time to meet his mother,
the young ladies, and his Cousin Frank, in the drawing-room
before they went down-stairs.</p>

<p>As Frank was a member of the family, he had every
right and excuse, though not living in the house, to linger
after dinner. He felt loath to depart. Not only was
every moment spent in the presence of Lois exquisitely
sweet to him; but it might be long before he could conveniently
obtain so favorable an opportunity for speaking
to her as he should probably find this evening. He
was right in staying; for the moment came at last.</p>

<p>Lady Quaintree was up-stairs, Gerald and Miss Dormer
were talking together, and there seemed no immediate
fear of interruption.</p>

<p>Then Frank Amberley braced up his nerves, and prepared
himself for the duty he had undertaken.</p>

<p>He thought it best to inform Lois of the entire story,
as far as he was master thereof, withholding the name
of the lady, however, and the fact that she had been already
married when she became the wife of Paul Desfrayne.
He thought that if the search for the Padre
Josef should prove unsuccessful, as it probably might do,
it would not be well either to unsettle Lois’ mind, or to
fix an additional brand on Captain Desfrayne.</p>

<p>Lois listened in dead silence, pulling out the lace of
her handkerchief mechanically. It was not until the
close of the little history that she made any comment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
Frank ended at the stormy departure of the signora on
the morning of her marriage with Captain Desfrayne.</p>

<p>“It is a sad story,” she said, in a low, faint tone. “I am
deeply sorry for him; and I am—I am sorry that—that
his name should have been—been linked with mine in—in
Mr. Vere Gardiner’s will.”</p>

<p>“I rely upon you not to let any one have a suspicion of
this unfortunate affair,” urged Frank Amberley.</p>

<p>Lois assured him she would keep the matter a profound
secret. She longed to get away to the solitude of
her own chamber, there to reflect on what she had heard;
but could think of no excuse. A strange, unaccountable
sinking of the heart oppressed her.</p>

<p>“Why do I thus think about one who is a stranger to
me, and can never be aught else?” she asked herself.
“I must dismiss the subject from my mind forever after
this night.”</p>

<p>And yet she caught herself wondering when she should
again meet Paul Desfrayne, and planning how she should
behave to him.</p>

<p>Frank Amberley watched her face with all the eager
devotion of a man hopelessly, irretrievably in love, utterly
unconscious that the bright eyes of the pretty country
girl in white muslin and blue ribbons wandered many
times his way. It was with difficulty that he restrained
a passionate, plainly worded avowal of his love and
adoration, and resisted the desire to ask Lois if there
was any chance of his being able to win the slightest return
of his all-engrossing passion.</p>

<p>He was pretty confident that up to this time she had
not cared specially for any one, and he believed it to be
perfectly impossible that any other human being could
love her as deeply, as truly as he did.</p>

<p>A few moments more, and he might have tempted his
fate, and might have gained some answer leading him
to hope; but the door of the center drawing-room opened,
and Lady Quaintree came through the silken archway
between the two salons.</p>

<p>Her ladyship was ill pleased to see Lois and Frank
together, and dissatisfied to notice that Gerald appeared
much taken with the lively, piquant Blanche Dormer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
who was playing with a not altogether unskilful hand at
the pleasant game of flirtation. It would not suit the
inclination of Lady Quaintree did Gerald fall in love
with and marry this young girl, even if she did carry
twenty thousand pounds as her dot.</p>

<p>Without appearing inhospitable—nay, she seemed to
be sorry to break up the little party—she made it apparent
to Frank that it would be only kind and considerate
of him to take an early departure, in order that the
ladies might rest after their hurried journey.</p>

<p>Turn which way she would, Lois could not rid herself
of the haunting figure of Paul Desfrayne. When she
gained her own room, she sat down at the foot of her
bed to think.</p>

<p>“I am glad, I know,” she whispered to herself. “Oh!
I am sorry for him, though I fear he scarcely deserves
that any one should pity him, when he was guilty of
such folly. He ought to have had more sense—he ought
not to have allowed himself to be carried away by such
a foolish fancy. Yet it seems a heavy punishment for
a passing folly. They say: ‘Marry in haste, repent at
leisure.’ Lifelong unhappiness, poor fellow! No wonder
he seems strange, and different from other people.
He is quite different from any one I ever saw. How
wicked and ungrateful this girl must have been! It is
inconceivable that any creature could have behaved so
vilely toward him. He seems so good, so kind, so——What
nonsense am I running off into, when I know
nothing about him!”</p>

<p class="center">THE FIGURE ROBED IN BLACK.</p>


<p>On leaving Alderman’s Lane, Captain Desfrayne made
a hurried luncheon, and then at once returned to the
station, to start therefrom back to his quarters.</p>

<p>He had forgotten to ascertain the exact hour at which
the train left; the consequence was he had to wait some
five-and-thirty minutes. That delay cost a life.</p>

<p>When fairly seated in the train, Paul had full leisure
for reflection. His thoughts were not pleasant.</p>

<p>He had not dared to stay to see his mother. It had
been difficult and bitter enough to tell her the fatal secret
of his unhappy marriage. To let her know the deeper
humiliation in which he found himself involved would
just now be impossible. It would be time enough to
reveal this additional misery when the search proved successful;
if it failed——</p>

<p>If it failed!</p>

<p>“I fancied I could not be more wretched,” he thought.
“I was mistaken. Could it be possible to wring a confession
from Guiscardini? Alas, no! Her nature is
absolutely callous. She would elect to be bound to me
rather than to my servant. How am I to face my servant—how
am I to tell my wretched story? My pride is
trailed in the dust. My name, given to my charge free
from spot or taint, is stained and splashed with shame.”</p>

<p>It was night before he reached Holston. Arrived
there, he engaged the last rickety old fly left within the
precincts of the station, and drove to the barracks.</p>

<p>The vehicle had lumbered its way almost to the gates,
when Captain Desfrayne, happening to look from the
open window, to ascertain how far it had proceeded, saw,
by the long, slanting rays cast from the lamps, a female
figure, draped in black, closely veiled, hurrying along
the road toward the station.</p>

<p>The mien, the step, even the somber robes, seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
somehow familiar to Paul Desfrayne. He put his hands
to his forehead in horror and despair.</p>

<p>“Great heavens! It is impossible!” he cried. “Am I
going out of my senses? Is this figure conjured up by
my disordered brain, or is it—can it be—Lucia Guiscardini?
It <i>cannot</i> be—and yet—and yet it is her very walk—her
insolent bearing.”</p>

<p>The wild idea that it might be her spirit for an instant
crossed his mind—a pardonable notion in the excited
state of his brain, for the swiftly gliding form looked
spectral in the blackness of the summer night, seeming
more shadowy from being draped in such dark vesture.</p>

<p>Recovering from the first shock, however, he hurriedly
stopped the vehicle, ordering the coachman to wait for
him, and ran back in the direction the misty form had
traversed.</p>

<p>He looked from side to side, and even struck with his
cane the bushes that grew by the edge of the road on
either hand, but no sign betrayed that any human creature
besides himself and the old man seated on the box of
the fly were within miles.</p>

<p>Distracted by contending feelings, he went hastily back
to the spot where he had left the vehicle. The driver, an
old and stupid man, was almost asleep, and stolidly
awaited the return of his fare, without troubling to guess
why he had so suddenly alighted.</p>

<p>“Did you see any one pass just now?” demanded Captain
Desfrayne excitedly.</p>

<p>“No, sur, I can’t say I did,” replied the driver.</p>

<p>“Not a woman?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul.”</p>

<p>“A woman dressed in black, walking very quickly toward
the station?”</p>

<p>“I see no one at all, sur. Be there onything wrong at
all?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell. I hope not. You think, if any one
passed along this road, they must go to the station?”</p>

<p>“Unless they stopped in the fields.”</p>

<p>“Is your horse very tired?”</p>

<p>“No—he bain’t so fresh as he moight be, but——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>“I want to return to the station for a few minutes,
and after that to resume my way to the barracks,” said
Paul Desfrayne. “Drive as fast as you can.”</p>

<p>So firmly persuaded was he of the reality of Lucia
Guiscardini’s appearance on this lonely spot that he was
resolved to seek some information of the clerk and porters
at the railway. He reentered the shaky old vehicle;
the stolid old driver whipped the weary old horse, and
in a minute they were returning the way they came.</p>

<p>There was just a possibility that he might surprise her
at the station. What conceivable motive could she have
had for coming hither? Probably to see Gilardoni, her
legal and legitimate husband. But why visit him in this
secret manner, when at any moment she could have commanded
his presence at a place infinitely more suitable?
There was not much doubt that her apparition boded
evil.</p>

<p>As the fly came in sight of the station, Paul had the
satisfaction of seeing the last train for London slowly
puff and snort its way along its destined iron track.</p>

<p>“Wait here until I come back,” he said to the coachman,
and then rushed into the station.</p>

<p>“Did a lady dressed in black take a ticket here just
now?” he asked of the ticket-clerk.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne looked about for one of the porters.
After a little delay he found one half-asleep on a bench,
for the last trains had departed for the night. He shook
the man by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Did you see a lady dressed in black just now? I
believe she must have gone by the train to London, and
must have had a return ticket.”</p>

<p>“I was not here when the train for London left, sir,”
replied the man respectfully. “The other porter was on
duty—I was in the office.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?” demanded Paul Desfrayne.</p>

<p>He seemed destined to be baffled at every turn.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’s gone, sir.”</p>

<p>An inquiry resulted in proving the fear to be correct.
Another inquiry elicited the fact that he lived a mile
and a half away across some fields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>In no very enviable frame of mind, Captain Desfrayne
returned to his waiting fly, to continue his broken
journey to the barracks.</p>

<p>“Did you find her, sur?” asked the flyman.</p>

<p>The young man shook his head, too much dejected, and
even physically exhausted, to be able to otherwise reply.</p>

<p>At length he reached his quarters, when he dismissed
the vehicle in which he had come. To-morrow he meant
to seek once again for evidence as to whether the lady
dressed in black had been seen by any other than himself.</p>

<p>His rooms seemed strangely silent as he approached
them. Gilardoni had hitherto contrived to make his presence
cheerful, and always had a reality as well as words
of welcome for his master. A bright glow of pleasant
light, gleaming through doors ajar, a slight movement of
ever-busy feet or hands, had given under his influence
a faint tinge of <i>home</i>.</p>

<p>The door of the first room was ajar, though scarce
perceptibly so. A dim ray of light struggled through,
as if seeking to disclose some ghastly secret. A silence
as of the grave reigned. Apparently not a living creature
was within the apartments.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne paused for a minute or two before entering.
A strange, painful foreboding seized him. What
he feared he dared not admit to himself.</p>

<p>What if that woman—Lucia Guiscardini—had come
hither with some sinister motive, and had slain her husband
in one of her almost ungovernable fits of passion?</p>

<p>But no, it could not be. What end could she hope
to gain? She valued her own safety, her own ease; she
prized this beautiful and splendid world too highly to
let her temper carry her to such a dangerous extreme.</p>

<p>Gilardoni had fallen asleep. The hour was late, and
he was, no doubt, weary with waiting.</p>

<p>Taking up the heavy lamp, Paul held it above his head
as he entered the second chamber, which was a sitting-room.</p>

<p>Directly opposite to the door, in an oblique direction,
was a couch, the first object on which Captain Desfrayne’s
eyes rested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>At full length upon this couch, in an attitude that
seemed to indicate the young man was enjoying an easy
sleep, lay Leonardo Gilardoni.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne placed the lamp on a side table, and
then said rather loudly:</p>

<p>“Gilardoni, my good fellow!”</p>

<p>The recumbent figure made no sign of awaking. Paul
Desfrayne, seriously uneasy, but still fighting with his
fears, crossed the room, and placed a hand on the sleeper’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Gilardoni, awake!” he said, in a voice which, spite of
his effort at self-constraint, trembled.</p>

<p>Not the faintest sound issued from the pallid lips. Not
a movement showed the smallest sign of life.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne at last placed the palm of his hand
upon the temples of the apparently sleeping man. They
were almost ice-cold.</p>

<p>The young officer caught the hands lying outstretched
on either side the silent, rigid form, and felt for the
pulse, his heart throbbing so violently as well-nigh to
suffocate him.</p>

<p>With a groan of despair, he dropped the cold hands.
Leonardo Gilardoni was dead.</p>

<p>One cruel touch had sent him from the world—one
touch of those delicate waxen fingers he had loved so
much and kissed with transport so often—one little stroke
from the hand of the woman he had so fatally wasted
his heart upon, the wife he had idolized, for whom he
would have laid down his life willingly in the days of his
fond, blind worship.</p>

<p>Only too truly did Paul Desfrayne now understand
the meaning of that woman’s mysterious presence here.
But why had she come—for what reason had she risked
her very life—what advantage did she promise herself
from this horrible deed? It was absolutely impossible
she could have heard anything of the projected search
for her brother. The only idea he could conjure up
was that the Padre Josef was on his way back to Europe.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">LUCIA GUISCARDINI’S DIAMOND RING.</p>


<p>Paul Desfrayne’s eyes had not deceived him. He had
really and truly seen Lucia Guiscardini hurrying away
from the scene of her murderous treachery.</p>

<p>A woman of insatiable ambition, she had resolved to
let nothing stand in the way of her advancement to
the highest dignities she could hope to reach.</p>

<p>Ignorant, ungovernable in her temper, resentful when
any one crossed her path, or tried to hinder her from
following her own fancies, she was at once resolute in
planning schemes, and unscrupulous in carrying them
out.</p>

<p>During her brief flight to Paris, on escaping what she
felt would be a useless interview with Captain Desfrayne,
she had reflected with all the force of her cunning brain
as to the course she should take.</p>

<p>It was true that a Russian prince, reputed to be of
fabulous wealth, was devoted to her, and had offered
his heart, hand, royal coronet, and vast possessions. His
diamonds alone would have been a lure to her; and
neither by day nor by night could she resist the glittering,
delicious dreams conjured up by his offers.</p>

<p>She had not destroyed the marriage-register stolen
from the charge of her brother—not because she was
withheld from the deed by any conscientious scruple,
but she did not know what the punishment for so black
a crime might be were she ever discovered.</p>

<p>Until she accidentally saw Leonardo Gilardoni speaking
to Captain Desfrayne, she had not for some time
been aware whether he was living or dead.</p>

<p>A sudden terror seized her when she found that these
two men had come together. It would have been a
welcome relief if she could have been sure they would
release her from her bondage; but she knew that both
had every reason to hate her with the bitterness of men
who had been utterly ruined by her cruel hand, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
she felt persuaded that they were bent on dragging her
to justice.</p>

<p>She kept the book she so keenly abhorred hidden in a
cabinet with a peculiar lock and several secret drawers,
and, in fear lest Leonardo should be the means of a
search being made among the papers, she thought and
thought until her head ached from sheer pain and weariness
of the desirability of burning the telltale pages.
But the vague dread of the unknown penalty withheld
her, even when she once took out the parchment-covered
volume, and stood contemplating it. She had but to
ignite a taper close at hand, and the deed would be accomplished
in a few minutes.</p>

<p>“But I dare not,” she shudderingly decided. “No; I
must pursue another plan.”</p>

<p>With infinite caution and craftiness, she ascertained
whither Paul Desfrayne had gone, and found for certain
that he had taken Gilardoni with him. Determined to
see her husband, but afraid to send for him, or to leave
any trace that they had met, she had dressed herself in
plain dark clothes, of a very different description from
those she usually wore, and had gone down to Holston.</p>

<p>As the express arrived in London, the train in which
she was to start was slowly filling with passengers. From
the window of the second-class carriage, in which she
had purposely seated herself, she had seen Paul Desfrayne
alight, and then linger to speak with the young
lady, whose appearance was completely unfamiliar to
the Italian singer. She felt thankful that there would
be no risk of meeting him at Holston.</p>

<p>A porter happened to be near the door of the compartment,
and she asked him when the next train would
leave London for Holston. The man went to look at
the time-table, and returned with the information that
there would not be one until 6:15. She thanked the porter
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Good,” she thought to herself. “I shall have time
enough for my little talk.”</p>

<p>Arrived at Holston, she walked toward the barracks,
which, unless she could not help herself, she did not
intend to enter. There was a dingy, uninviting public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
house in the vicinity, and a few cottages sprinkled
about.</p>

<p>After a brief consideration, she went up to one of the
most decent-looking of the latter, where an old woman
sat knitting by the door.</p>

<p>The old dame readily allowed her to sit down, and,
after a short, desultory talk, the signora, who affected
to be a very plain person indeed, asked the woman if
there was any boy about who would run on a message
to the barracks.</p>

<p>“I want to see my husband,” she said very simply.
“You see, he and I had a quarrel before he left London,
and I am so unhappy. I believe I was to blame; but I
don’t want to go there, and be looked at by the men
there. My husband might be displeased by my coming.”</p>

<p>The old dame sympathized with the young wife’s
feelings, and readily found a lout of a boy, who stared
with all his eyes at the beautiful stranger in the somber
garments.</p>

<p>Madam Guiscardini gave him a tiny note in a sealed
envelope, directed to Mr. Gilardoni, and slipped a shilling
into his hand. She could not venture to give him
more, lest he should talk. The boy went, and the signora
waited, listening to the old woman’s talk, and comprehending
no more of her babble than she did of the
buzzing of the bees and flies in the neat little garden.</p>

<p>Within half an hour she saw, as she looked eagerly
from the window, the well-known form of Leonardo Gilardoni
rapidly approaching the cottage, accompanied by
her messenger. Her note had contained only a line or
two, in Italian:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Leonardo, I would see you. I have something of
importance to say to you. The bearer of this will tell
you where to find me.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Lucia.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>She was still standing by the window when he entered
the diminutive room. They had not met since that
day he had surprised her in the garden at Florence. The
recollection of that day came back on both with a rush.</p>

<p>Leonardo paused on the threshold. Lucia did not
move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>“You have sent for me?” he said.</p>

<p>The signora shrugged her shoulders and smiled mockingly,
it seemed to her husband.</p>

<p>“Why have you sent for me?” he demanded.</p>

<p>She left her place by the window, and came near to
him.</p>

<p>“What I have to say,” she answered, “I would not
that other ears than yours should hear. Will you walk
a little way with me toward the corn-fields I see yonder?”
pointing from the window at the back of the room.</p>

<p>“It is indifferent to me where I listen to you. It is
impossible you can have aught to say that will be pleasant
for me to hear,” replied Gilardoni bitterly.</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen,” she lightly replied. “Perhaps
I may have something to say that will please you
very much indeed.”</p>

<p>For a moment he thought that perhaps she knew her
brother was coming back, and that she desired to offer
some kind of compromise, or to throw herself on his
mercy. But he followed very quietly as she led the way
down the narrow path of the garden at the rear of the
cottage, brushing past the common yet sweet-smelling
humble country flowers, until they were at the bottom,
and could step unimpeded into a piece of ground that
ran between the garden and the corn-field, where the
golden grain lay like a yellow sea.</p>

<p>Here no one could possibly overhear what passed, and
presently they would be out of sight of even the cottages
that lay sprinkled about. Then Lucia spoke. Her voice
was firm and calm, her manner composed.</p>

<p>“Leonardo Gilardoni, I acknowledge no claim you
may choose to make upon me, but I wish to be free from
any annoyance you may possibly, from spite, think fit
to bring upon me. I have received offers of marriage
from a nobleman of the highest rank, and of immense
wealth. It is my purpose to accept these offers.”</p>

<p>“While you are the wife of another?” exclaimed Gilardoni.</p>

<p>“Prove your words,” she disdainfully replied. “But
that you cannot do, be they true or false. I have not
come here to bandy words with you as to my real position.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
I am well aware that, although your accusations
would be totally without foundation, yet, if breathed to
his highness, they would prejudice him against me.
Therefore, I wish to silence you. If you refuse to accede
to my proposition, it does not signify your using it as
an additional proof of your base calumnies, for you will
not be able to show that I ever made it.”</p>

<p>“Go on. Your proposition?”</p>

<p>“If you will agree to sign a paper, acknowledging that
there is not the slightest foundation for your assertion
that I have been married before—to you—and will further
agree that on signing this paper you will depart for
America, and promise never to return, I will settle ten
thousand pounds on you. Nay, do not speak. I trust
to your promise, for I know you would not break your
word, nor would you promise lightly.”</p>

<p>Leonardo Gilardoni broke into a bitter laugh as he
folded his arms and looked his wife steadily in the face.</p>

<p>She raised her hands almost in a supplicating manner,
and for a moment he idly noticed the flash and
sparkle of a wonderfully brilliant ring upon her finger.</p>

<p>“You mean this proposition seriously?” he asked.</p>

<p>A malevolent light gleamed in the lustrous eyes of
Madam Guiscardini, and a spiteful smile curled round
the ruby-red lips.</p>

<p>“You think I love you so well that I have taken the
trouble and run the risk of secretly traveling all the way
hither from London for the sake of lightly enjoying a
passing jest with you?” she sibilated.</p>

<p>“Accept my offer, and see if it be really meant or not.
I know you to be of a dogged, stubborn nature. I know,
to my cost, that once you take a crotchet into your head,
nothing can displace it. I once appealed to your love—a
passion I neither believe in nor comprehend—I wept
at your feet, and you turned a deaf ear to my entreaties.
Silence! Hear me!</p>

<p>“I never cared for you, and now I hate you! I appealed
to your <i>love</i>—now I appeal to your interest.
Surely—surely—surely you will not refuse a fortune.
Surely your hate of me cannot lead you to vindictively
mar my brilliant prospects. Perhaps it is folly to admit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
that a few injurious words from you could turn his
highness against me; but I am frank with you.</p>

<p>“Of course, I might laugh your accusations to scorn,
but the prince might—well, your words might hurt me,
for that man is as proud as Lucifer, although his absurd
infatuation, which he calls love, induces him to lay all
his earthly possessions, all his ancient prejudices, at the
feet of a ‘singing-woman.’ With ten thousand pounds
you will be rich; you will begin a new life, be happy with
some meek-spirited, pretty Griselda, who may fly to fulfil
your slightest wish or command.”</p>

<p>She had spoken so rapidly that, as she paused, her
breath came in quick gasps. For the first time since she
had entered on this conversation, her heart beat violently.</p>

<p>“You think I would sell my soul for ten thousand
pounds,” Leonardo Gilardoni slowly said—“my soul and
yours, my wife? I decline.”</p>

<p>“You do not mean it! You say so that I may double
the price!” exclaimed the signora. “No. Speak. What
sum do you ask to fall in with my wishes?”</p>

<p>Gilardoni looked fixedly into the luminous eyes so
eagerly fastened upon him, as if he would read the innermost
thoughts they so partially revealed.</p>

<p>“You know me well enough, you say, to be aware that
once I have made up my mind to what is right, nothing
will turn me from it,” he coldly replied. “I say distinctly
that you are my wife, by all the laws of Heaven and man,
and while I live you cannot marry any other. I refuse
to comply with your infamous desire. I have said it.
Had I the means, I would go to South America, to seek
your brother, who could prove our marriage. What
have you done with the book you stole?”</p>

<p>A sudden thought seized Lucia Guiscardini. Paul
Desfrayne had surely discovered her previous marriage,
and was about to send Gilardoni in search of the Padre
Josef. If so, she was probably ruined. Her plan had
been to rid herself by bribery of Gilardoni, and then to
make a proposition to Paul Desfrayne, making it a matter
of mutual interest to keep the second marriage a
dead secret.</p>

<p>Only too well she knew that once Gilardoni had said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
no, it would be impossible to persuade him to say yes.
If these two men—he and his master—combined against
her, adieu to her dazzling hopes. She had trusted that
Gilardoni’s evident poverty would render him a willing
accomplice to her nefarious scheme, and now she was
furious at her failure.</p>

<p>In the event of finding her husband utterly intractable,
she had designed another and infinitely darker
course, which she resolved to carry into execution. For
a few moments she remained silent, ignoring Gilardoni’s
direct question, and then she merely said:</p>

<p>“Good-by, then! We shall probably never meet again.
I defy you! I hope your spite may not be able to hurt
me; but I do not fear you. My offer was made to save
myself annoyance. Say what you can, the worst your
vindictive fancy may invent, your words will be but
empty air. Proof you have none. Go on your preposterous
chase if you will. I care not.”</p>

<p>She held out her hand mockingly. As she expected,
Gilardoni refused to clasp it, and, in affected anger at his
repulse, she struck him lightly, her closed fingers passing
across his wrist. Then she turned, and, before Gilardoni
had time either to speak or detain her, she had gained
the road.</p>

<p>The terrible deed she had contemplated being accomplished
beyond human recall, the miserable woman was
seized with a kind of terror and exhaustion. Having
placed herself out of sight, she sat down by a great tree,
creeping under its shelter so as to remain unseen by any
one who might be passing. Daring to the last degree of
recklessness in plotting, she yet lacked the iron nerves
that were needed to support her in her criminal schemes.
Faint and exhausted, she stayed here until some time
after nightfall, and then fled toward the station.</p>

<p>As Captain Desfrayne passed, she was unable to recognize
him, his face and form being shrouded in darkness
within the vehicle, and when he had alighted and pursued
her, she had not dared to look back.</p>

<p>Gilardoni had remained motionless when she left him,
immersed in painful thoughts.</p>

<p>“Good Heaven!” he said aloud; “and I once loved this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
woman! It would not be spite nor hate; but were she
to trap any innocent man to his ruin, it would be my duty
to speak.”</p>

<p>He clasped his hands above his head in a transport
of grief, and then, for the first time, felt a slight pain.
He glanced at his left wrist, and found it smirched with
crimson blood. The wound, he supposed, had been inflicted
by the large diamond ring he had noticed on his
wife’s finger.</p>

<p>Binding his handkerchief about the wrist, he turned
to retrace his steps. He would have regarded that faint
scratch very differently had he known that his life-blood
was already imbued with a subtle narcotic poison emanating
from one of the stones in that ring.</p>

<p>As he entered his master’s rooms he was conscious
of a strange faintness and an unpleasant burning of the
tongue. He had found some difficulty in ascending the
staircase, and had scarcely lighted the lamp, when he
crept into the second apartment, and threw himself on
a couch, feeling as if utterly exhausted.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what is the matter with me,” he muttered,
passing his hand over his forehead. “I have taken
nothing that could hurt me. I suppose it’s a reaction.
That was a painful meeting with—with my wife. May
Heaven forgive her all her wickedness toward me, though—though——Strange,
this weakness seems to increase,
and my thoughts are wandering.”</p>

<p>The faintness grew worse, so did the burning in his
mouth and throat. The unhappy man rose, and endeavored
to drink some water, but the effort to swallow
was too painful.</p>

<p>“May Heaven forgive <i>me</i> all my sins!” he murmured.
“I believe I am dying. Dying!” he wildly repeated, raising
himself suddenly, and looking about distractedly, then
glancing down at his hand. “Dying! She has destroyed
me. Oh, Lucia—Lucia—Lucia!”</p>

<p>Burning tears forced their way as he sank back. By
degrees he floated into a kind of sleep, and then he forgot
everything.</p>

<p>And as he lay dead in the silence of that lonely room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
the woman who had so remorselessly slain him was
hastening back to the great city, there to still further
shape out the path that was to conduct her——</p>

<p>Whither—whither?</p>

<p>To the almost regal chambers of her princely lover,
or to the condemned cell of the manslayer?</p>

</div>

<p class="center">FRANK AMBERLEY’S MISSION.</p>


<p>The next morning Mr. Amberley went to his office as
usual.</p>

<p>As he passed the door on which appeared the name of
Mr. Willis Joyner—the back room on the first floor—the
dapper figure and pleasant face of that gentleman
appeared on the threshold. In spite of his age and his
gray whiskers, Mr. Willis Joyner was preferred by many
moneyed spinsters and richly jointured widows even
before the grave, handsome Mr. Amberley, who never
paid any compliments, and apparently regarded business
as business, and never sweetened the sourness and dryness
of the law with the acceptable honey of soft words
and smiling glances.</p>

<p>“Ah! thought ’twas you, Amberley,” said Mr. Willis.
“Thought I knew your step. Want to see you when
you’ve looked over your letters.”</p>

<p>“All right,” was Mr. Amberley’s very simple rejoinder,
as he pursued his upward course.</p>

<p>In ten minutes or a quarter of an hour he came back.</p>

<p>Mr. Willis Joyner wanted to see him about “that affair
of Frampton’s,” Frampton being a wealthy commoner
who was going to marry a rich baron’s sister, and
the “affair” being one of very complicated marriage-settlements.</p>

<p>Some lively talk from the said Mr. Willis Joyner of
the one part, and some quiet listening from the said Mr.
Frank Amberley of the other part, resulted in the agreement
that the younger gentleman should repair at once
to Brompton, to have an interview with somebody concerned
on some knotty and disputed point.</p>

<p>Frank Amberley went off. About half an hour after
his departure, a youth came into the office with a telegram
marked “Immediate.”</p>

<p>“Is there any answer wanted, do you know?” inquired
the melancholy clerk to whom he delivered it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“No, I don’t. I’d better wait and see,” answered the
messenger.</p>

<p>“Mr. Amberley ain’t in. I’ll ask Mr. Willis,” said the
clerk.</p>

<p>Mr. Willis turned it over in his dainty white fingers,
and said it must be left for Mr. Amberley, who might
be away for a couple of hours. It was uncertain when
he might be back.</p>

<p>The telegram was accordingly stuck in the rack, and
the bearer went away. It was from Captain Desfrayne,
informing Frank Amberley of the sudden death of Gilardoni,
the valet.</p>

<p>Unconscious of the tragical revolution which had
taken place in Paul Desfrayne’s affairs, the young lawyer
pursued his way, planning to return as soon as his
immediate business should have been disposed of.</p>

<p>It was not until he was some distance from the office,
rattling westward in a hansom, that he remembered he
had left no message in case Gilardoni should call early
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>It would certainly be desirable to see Madam Guiscardini
before fixing any plan with the Italian valet; but
could such a thing be hoped for as obtaining an interview
with this beautiful tigress, and even granting that
she condescended to let herself be spoken with, it was
impossible to hope that she would betray a scrap of evidence
against herself.</p>

<p>After some trouble, Frank Amberley succeeded in concluding
his business with the irascible old gentleman at
Blythe Villas, Brompton, to whom he had been despatched.</p>

<p>Coming out from the house, he stood for several minutes
on the pavement before he reentered his waiting
hansom. He consulted his watch, and found it was yet
early—only half-past twelve.</p>

<p>“I can but be refused,” he said to himself. “She must
be at home at this hour, I should imagine, and, by the
time I reach the place, will have about dressed, I suppose.
We can do nothing until she has had the chance of
speaking, and she might give me a clue as to the place
where her brother may be found.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>Stepping into the hansom, he said:</p>

<p>“Porchester Square.”</p>

<p>On the way he laid out the sketch of one of those
imaginary dialogues which never by any possibility take
place. He started by fancying himself, after some delay,
perhaps, admitted to the drawing-room of the famous
prima donna. She might or might not be there. At all
events, he would politely introduce himself by name; and
then he went on to picture the succeeding talk, ending in
two ways, one conceiving her to make fatal admissions
against herself, the other supposing her to contemptuously
defy him, and laugh all his crafty advances to
scorn.</p>

<p>The driver of the hansom shot round the angle of the
square. But when he was within a few doors of the
house where Madam Guiscardini resided, he perceived
that there was already drawn up in front of the curb
facing the portico another and far more important vehicle
than his own—a splendidly appointed brougham, the
gray horses attached to which were handsomely caparisoned
in gleaming silver harness. The graceful animals
stood perfectly still, except when they half-impatiently
threw up their heads, jingling their elegant appointments,
or pawed the ground, as if anxious to start off.</p>

<p>The cabman drove past the vehicle a few feet, and then
drew up, to wait further orders.</p>

<p>It instantly struck the young lawyer that this might
be Madam Guiscardini’s brougham, and that probably
she was going out. He had heard that she never attended
the theater in the morning when she was to perform
in the evening, so she might not be going to the
opera-house; but, at all events, she was in all likelihood
on the point of taking a drive somewhere. He determined
to wait for some moments.</p>

<p>“Turn the other way—right round—and then stop for
a while,” he said to the cabman. “If I should jump out
very suddenly, and go into that house, do not take any
notice, but wait quietly here until I come back.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” said cabby, obeying the first part of his
instructions.</p>

<p>Frank thus faced the brougham, which he had seen in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
dashing past, and could see the street-door, at present
closed.</p>

<p>Had Lucia Guiscardini happened to be in her dining-room,
drawing-room, or bedroom, all of which looked
out on the square, she might possibly have descried the
mysterious waiting vehicle standing opposite, or nearly
opposite, to her house, and, seeing the watchful figure
with the dark-bearded, thoughtful face, might by accident
have taken an alarm, and so countermanding her orders
for the drive, and denying herself on the score of a fit of
indisposition to any stranger inquiring for her, have
temporarily escaped a dangerous interview.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately for herself, madam was in her
dressing-room, a dainty apartment behind her bedroom,
and only separated from it by silken and lace curtains.
She was occupied in three different ways—completing
her exquisite toilet, scolding and snarling at her French
maid, and cooing over a tangled skein of floss silk, from
which peered forth an infinitesimal black snout and two
bright, glittering brown eyes.</p>

<p>Dress was a reigning passion with Lucia, and this day
she was doubly absorbed, in spite of the racking state
of her mind consequent upon the daring criminal step
she had taken the night before.</p>

<p>Madam was going first to the opera-house, to excuse
herself to the manager, armed with a medical certificate
to the effect that she was incapable of singing that evening,
from a painful attack of hoarseness. This excuse
was in reality not ill-founded, for she had taken a slight
chill in her hurried journey the previous night.</p>

<p>She felt it would be utterly impossible to sing that
evening. As it was, her hands were trembling from
nervous excitement; the faintest sound, if unexpected,
made her start with trepidation; her eyes and cheeks
were aflame. Had it not been that she was remarkably
abstemious, Finette would have suspected madam to be
suffering from the effects of an overdose of champagne.</p>

<p>The second place to which she was bound was a garden-party,
where she had smilingly promised her princely
adorer she would show herself for at least a few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>“If I go on at this rate,” the signora thought at last, “I
shall be ill. Come what may, I must brace up my nerves,
and try to compose myself. It would be ruin to my
hopes if I fell ill just now.”</p>

<p>She shuddered as she fancied she might be seized with
fever, and lose her wits, perhaps, and betray in her wanderings
the crime of which she had been guilty within
these past twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>At length she was arrayed, all save the right-hand
glove; but she could not stay to put that on now, lest she
should be too late at the opera-house to enable the manager
to make other arrangements for the night. The
little white hands were loaded with blazing jewels, that
sparkled and flashed in the light; but she no longer wore
the fatal diamond ring that had scratched Gilardoni, the
valet, on the wrist.</p>

<p>As she swept down the richly carpeted stairs, her movements
signalized by the soft frou-frou of her Parisian
garments, she meditated chiefly on the impending storm
between herself and the director. She floated down to
the door, followed by Finette, who was carrying the tiny
bundle of floss silk, the denomination of which appeared
to be Bébé.</p>

<p>The door was held open by a lackey, in a plain but
exceedingly elegant livery. Madam hated all the male
servants in her own and other people’s houses, for they
often reminded her of the position to which had sunk the
man whose legal wife she was.</p>

<p>But there was nothing in the sweetly modulated accents,
and in the absent, preoccupied eyes of the beautiful
mistress of the house to betray any feeling either way
toward the domestic as she said:</p>

<p>“I shall be home about six. Dinner at seven.”</p>

<p>The servant bowed, though a lightninglike glance at
Finette behind the signora’s back indicated surprise, for
if madam dined at seven, she evidently did not mean to
go to the opera, at all events as a performer.</p>

<p>Madam put out one tiny foot to reach her brougham,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
but drew back with a deep breath that narrowly escaped
being a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>Standing just within the portico was a tall, gentlemanly-looking
man, a stranger to her, hat in hand, waiting
to address her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THE INLAID CABINET.</p>


<p>The sight of any and every stranger who spoke to or
even looked at Lucia must henceforth inevitably cause
her a thrill of fear.</p>

<p>She had never seen this handsome young man with
the dark, grave, penetrating eyes before, to her knowledge;
yet he looked at her as if he would read her very
soul.</p>

<p>Frank, the instant the door opened, had bounded from
his cab, and was waiting for the signora to issue forth.
He bowed profoundly.</p>

<p>“Madam Guiscardini, I believe?” he said.</p>

<p>He had recognized her at the first glance, having frequently
seen her at the opera, both in London and in
Paris, and being furthermore made familiar with her
strikingly marked features and imperial figure by the innumerable
photographs issued by London and Parisian
firms.</p>

<p>It was impossible for madam to deny her own identity.
Frank noticed that she grew pale—perceptibly so, and
that the jeweled fingers of her ungloved hand twitched
nervously.</p>

<p>“My name is Guiscardini,” she replied, after a slight
hesitation, and speaking in frigid accents.</p>

<p>“May I beg the favor of a few moments’ private conversation
with you, madam?” asked Frank Amberley.
“My business is of the utmost importance, or I should
not delay you just as you are going out.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” angrily replied the cantatrice, her lips
trembling from mingled rage and fear. She imagined
that perhaps this gentlemanly fellow, with the handsome
face and urbane manners, might be a detective in
disguise. “It is impossible, my time is not my own, and
I cannot grant you even five minutes.”</p>

<p>She glanced at the jeweled watch that hung at her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
waist amid a coruscation of enameled lockets and miscellaneous
toys and trinkets.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to be so pressing, madam, but if you will
give me ten minutes—I promise to go by the dial of your
own watch—I will not trespass longer.”</p>

<p>He knew well that the business he came on could not
be disposed of in that time, but relied on the hope that
she would, if persuaded to enter on it, voluntarily extend
the time.</p>

<p>“Who are you, and what do you want?” demanded
Madam Guiscardini sharply, looking keenly at him.</p>

<p>“My name, madam, is Amberley—I have the honor to
belong to the firm of Messrs. Salmon, Joyner &amp; Joyner,
who are solicitors.”</p>

<p>“What do you want? I will not hear you, sir! Let me
pass, sir. You are rude and unmannerly not to take a
reasonable refusal. Let me pass, sir, I say—I insist!”</p>

<p>She tried to push by him, in order to get to her
brougham, the door of which was held open by the powdered
lackey who had been sitting beside the coachman.</p>

<p>Frank Amberley laid a firm, detaining grip on her
wrist as she passed by.</p>

<p>“Madam Guiscardini,” he whispered in her ear, “you
would consult your own interest in consenting to hear
me. I come from Captain Paul Desfrayne, and I wish
to ask you a few questions about Leonardo Gilardoni.”</p>

<p>This time the signora could not restrain the scream
that rose to her lips. She stared wildly about her, and
then at the enemy who had so suddenly sprung up before
her.</p>

<p>The idea that he was a detective became almost a certainty.
He had come to tax her with her double crime.
She must be cool and quiet, she thought the next moment,
and strive not to betray herself.</p>

<p>Whatever he had to say, however, must not be said before
these prying, gossiping menials. With surprising
quickness, she rallied her forces, resisted the inclination
to swoon, and without answering her strange visitor,
turned back to Finette.</p>

<p>“Put on your bonnet, girl, quick as lightning, and go
to the opera-house,” she said to her maid. “Tell Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
Mervyn that I was on my way to him, but was detained
at the last moment, and that I shall not be able to sing
to-night. Take this medical certificate with you.”</p>

<p>Finette took the paper, and flew up-stairs, glad of the
chance of a pleasant drive, yet vexed that she could not
stay to find out the mystery that was going on.</p>

<p>Madam Guiscardini turned to Frank Amberley.</p>

<p>“Follow me,” she said, in harsh accents.</p>

<p>She glided up to the drawing-room, feeling at every
step as if her knees must yield under her. The young
lawyer silently followed her, wondering at the success
which had attended his effort to obtain an interview with
her.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, may I ask the nature of your business with
me?” madam said, when she had closed the door, across
which she pulled the silken portière to deaden the sounds
from within, for she distrusted all her servants. She advanced
to the windows, as the point farthest away from
the reach of eavesdroppers, but neither seated herself nor
asked her visitor to sit down.</p>

<p>“You may imagine that I have nothing very agreeable
to say, judging by the quarter from which I come,”
said Frank Amberley.</p>

<p>“You say you come from Captain Desfrayne? What
business can you have to transact between Captain Desfrayne
and myself?” asked the signora, with an affectation
of surprise and curiosity.</p>

<p>“You do not mention the other name.”</p>

<p>“What other name?”</p>

<p>“The name of Leonardo Gilardoni—of your husband,
madam.”</p>

<p>The wretched woman’s hand closed on the slender
inlaid back of a chair for support. Every vestige of
color faded from her face, and her eyes looked haggard
for a moment.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whom you mean,” she whispered, rather
than said.</p>

<p>“That is a falsehood, madam.”</p>

<p>“Why should you say that? By what right or license
do you come within my house to harass—to torture me?”</p>

<p>Frank Amberley was almost amazed by the singular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
effect his few preparatory words seemed to have, and
could not reasonably account for it. This woman’s demeanor
was entirely different from what Paul Desfrayne
had yesterday prognosticated it would be. Why should
she evidence this fear—this shrinking? He felt there
must be some further mystery to solve, some new secret
to unravel. Had he known the contents of the telegram
then waiting for him in Alderman’s Lane, he would have
had a clue. As it was, he was mystified.</p>

<p>Had Lucia Guiscardini, on the other hand, known the
simple nature of his errand, she would have entirely controlled
herself. But she already in fancy could imagine
his arresting grip on her shoulder, and the odd query
rose in her mind: “Will he handcuff me?”</p>

<p>“By what right do I come?” Frank Amberley slowly
repeated, watching every change and variation in her agitated
face. “By the right of justice.”</p>

<p>“Justice? I do not understand you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, you do. I may as well inform you that Captain
Desfrayne, the man whom you so basely, so ungratefully
entrapped into an illegal marriage—the man
whose life you have blighted, whose happiness you have
ruined——”</p>

<p>“Well? Be brief, I beg of you, for, as I told you at
first, my time is limited, and most precious,” interrupted
Madam Guiscardini.</p>

<p>This circumlocution, however, gave her a ray of hope
that her first fear was groundless.</p>

<p>“Captain Desfrayne has told me the whole miserable
story of infamous deception.”</p>

<p>“What story?”</p>

<p>“Come, madam, your affectation of ignorance is useless,
and only a waste of time. You cannot deny that
while you hold Captain Desfrayne in legal bondage, you
are in reality the wife, by a prior marriage, of a man
who is in his service—one Leonardo Gilardoni.”</p>

<p>The words “<i>you are</i>” were like the sound of a trumpet
to the unhappy woman. It was palpable that this man
did not yet know of Gilardoni’s death. The strain upon
her nerves had been so fearful that she gave way the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
instant the relaxation came. She fell back on the chair
by which she stood, in violent hysterics.</p>

<p>Amazed by such apparently singular behavior, Frank
Amberley stood by, partly alarmed, partly resolved not
to summon assistance if he could help it, for he was determined
to follow up the advantage he seemed to have
gained.</p>

<p>Presently Lucia Guiscardini recovered her self-command.
She was glad none of the servants had been
called, though she would have welcomed the interruption
their presence would have caused.</p>

<p>“You are doubtless surprised, sir, that I should be thus
overcome,” she said. “But I am very unwell. I was
on my way to the theater to tell the director I could not
appear, in consequence of sudden illness. My nerves are
overstrained. The subject of my marriage with the gentleman
you name is a distressing one to me, and one upon
which I cannot enter without painful emotion. Of the
other person about whom you spoke I know nothing. I
have never heard his name. The person I have the misfortune
to call husband has evidently told you a false
story. He has treated me with meanness and cruelty, but
I have been generous enough not to betray him. Why
does he send you to me?”</p>

<p>“Because he thought you might listen to me where you
would only laugh in his face.”</p>

<p>“What does he want of me? Let him come himself.
At this moment, I wish to see him. I have something
of paramount importance to tell him.”</p>

<p>“You may treat me as his nearest friend and confidant
in this matter,” said the young man quietly. “What
you would say to him, you can say to me.”</p>

<p>“What guarantee have I that you really come from
him?” demanded the signora.</p>

<p>“Why should I raise a fiction of such a kind? What
good could I do myself or others by deceiving you?”</p>

<p>“I neither know nor care. With him I will treat—with
no other.”</p>

<p>“I will tell him so. But you had better hear what I
have to say on the part of Captain Desfrayne. Unfortunately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
we cannot prove your marriage with this Gilardoni.
Pray, madam, may I ask you one question?”</p>

<p>“Speak.”</p>

<p>“How is it that if, as you declare, you have never until
this day heard of Leonardo Gilardoni, his name causes
you to shudder violently?”</p>

<p>“That is your fancy, sir. I have a slight attack of
ague, from which I shiver every now and then,” replied
Madam Guiscardini icily.</p>

<p>“I do not believe you, Madam Guiscardini; but, as I
was saying, we cannot prove your first marriage, because
you have stolen the original register, and therefore——”</p>

<p>The young woman started from her seat in a kind of
frenzy. A moment’s reflection, however, caused her to
sink back.</p>

<p>“Mr. Amberley,” she said, very calmly, looking him
straight in the face with an expression of candor on her
own lovely visage, “every one has, I believe, a motive
for what they do. You say you come hither to-day in
the name of justice. What your object may further be
I do not know, as you have not as yet deigned to enlighten
me upon the precise nature of the demand you
apparently intend making upon me. I am convinced
that you, and it may be Captain Desfrayne, are deceived
by the concocted story of a man who desires to extort
money. I am supposed to be rich—I do not deny that
I have a great deal of money: I am therefore regarded
as a person to be preyed upon.</p>

<p>“Captain Desfrayne may be actuated by mean and cruel
objects in pursuing me, whom he has always treated in
so abominable a manner—his jealousy, his ill conduct,
obliged me unwillingly to leave him, for I desired to do
my duty as a wife, though I did not love him. You and
he have, you say, listened to a story told by some man
who asserts that—that—that I was—that I was married
to him. Plainly, why do you and Captain Desfrayne lend
yourselves to this infamous conspiracy? I do not intend
to tamely submit to robbery and insult, I can assure you.
Who is this man?”</p>

<p>“He is Captain Desfrayne’s valet,” said Frank Amberley,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
who had not attempted even once to interrupt the
long harangue with which he had been favored.</p>

<p>“As I should have imagined,” said Madam Guiscardini,
withering scorn in her look and voice, a disdainful
smile on her lips. “This man, whom the world supposes
to be a gentleman, because he wears the uniform of an
officer in the service of the King of England, puts his
servant forward to insult and harass me—will, perhaps,
urge him to attack me for money. You come to ask
me—what?”</p>

<p>Frank Amberley, who had remained standing from
the moment he entered the room until now, slightly
stooped, and, leaning forward, gazed intently into the
signora’s great, bold black eyes.</p>

<p>For some instants she bore this searching look; then
her guilty eyes sank, while the color flowed back to her
pale face. Her hands clenched with suppressed fury, and
it was with difficulty she refrained from giving way to a
burst of rage. But she feared she might betray herself
by a word inadvertently spoken, and so remained silent.</p>

<p>“You know, Madam Guiscardini, that what I have
asserted is perfectly true,” said the young man sternly.
“You, the wife of the Italian, Leonardo Gilardoni, trapped
my client into a marriage with you, believing yourself safe
because you had abstracted the evidence of your first marriage.
That evidence you did not dare to destroy—it still
exists.”</p>

<p>The signora raised her eyes, and looked at him in affright.</p>

<p>“What evidence?” she asked.</p>

<p>“The written register in the book belonging to the
chapel in which your brother married you to Gilardoni.”</p>

<p>“This is infamous. What do you hope by bullying
me in this manner?” exclaimed Madam Guiscardini.</p>

<p>“You asked what I wanted—why I had come. I will
tell you: Before we seek for your brother, the priest—the
Padre Josef—I wish to know what you have done with
the registry-book?”</p>

<p>His keenly practised eye caught a swift glance at hers,
gleaming like an instantaneous flash.</p>

<p>With a strange misgiving that she was entirely betrayed—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
possibly Finette or some other servant had
watched her, unseen, and reported her secret doings—she
glanced for a second at a tall cabinet standing in a
corner of the room, near the pianoforte—a curious old
piece of eighteenth-century furniture, inlaid with paintings
on enamel.</p>

<p>Frank Amberley lowered his gaze, and appeared simply
to wait for an answer.</p>

<p>“They have, then, sent you upon this ridiculous errand?”
said the signora. “It is a fool’s message, undertaken
by a simpleton.”</p>

<p>“You say this story has been hatched up by designing
persons, with a view to extort money——”</p>

<p>“Or by a pitiful coward who desires to harass and
torment me,” interrupted the young woman.</p>

<p>“Aye. As you will. I asked you where this book is
concealed. I know you have not destroyed it. You had
doubtless your own motives for preserving such a
damning piece of evidence against yourself——”</p>

<p>“I foresee that I shall be obliged to dismiss you from
the house, sir,” again interrupted Madam Guiscardini,
rising, concentrated fury blazing in her eyes. “You shall
not continue to annoy and insult me under my own
roof.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, madam. I do not wish to be other than
courteous in conducting this unpleasant affair. My own
interest in it is less than nothing. Did I consult my
own wishes, I should not lift a finger to coerce you.
Bear with me for a few moments longer. I said, I asked
you where this registry-book is hidden away. The question
was put merely to try you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed! Monsieur grows more and more incomprehensible.
May I hope that this preposterous little
farce is nearly played out?”</p>

<p>“Very nearly, madam. The terrible drama that has
been performed is also, I believe, almost at an end. I
<i>know</i> where that parchment-bound volume is.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Monsieur is, then, a magician—a juggler?
This begins to be amusing. I should like to see this wonderful
tome. But I should hope that your friends and
clients and coconspirators have not been so daring as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
forge written evidence against me? That would be too
terrible, though I do not fear the worst they can do.”</p>

<p>“The volume is near at hand,” pursued Frank, his eyes
never leaving her face for a second. As yet, every shot
had told with fatal effect.</p>

<p>“Near at hand,” repeated the unhappy young woman
mechanically. She felt certain now that she had been betrayed,
and her suspicions fell on Finette, the French
maid, whom she had always hated and mistrusted.</p>

<p>“Close at hand,” the lawyer said slowly, approaching
a step toward her. “It lies in this house.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that they have dared to place
their forged papers within my own dwelling?” demanded
Lucia Guiscardini, twisting and twining her fingers in
and out of one another.</p>

<p>But she only spoke thus to delay the last fatal moment.
Not knowing that he was proceeding chiefly upon
guesswork, guided by that one swift gleam from her own
eyes, she made sure he had certain information.</p>

<p>Finette had seen her open the cabinet, she thought, and
had seen her examine the suspicious-looking volume.
One hope remained: the girl might not know the secret
of the spring opening the inner compartment where the
book lay crouching amid laces and filmy handkerchiefs,
placed there to deceive any casual eye that might happen
to light upon the nook so cunningly devised.</p>

<p>“You cannot deny that the book is in this house—that
you carry it about with you—that——”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“That it is in this very room.”</p>

<p>“What more, sir? My patience, I warn you, is well-nigh
exhausted. Beware, sir—beware! My temper is
not of the most angelic mold, and I am very weary of
this folly.”</p>

<p>“Madam Guiscardini, I ask you plainly, is not that
stolen book in yonder cabinet?” demanded the young
lawyer.</p>

<p>It was his last throw, and he watched the result with
a keen and eager gaze.</p>

<p>The signora made one step, with an affrighted look, as
if to take flight. Then she paused, and drew two or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
three deep, sobbing breaths, like some wild animal
pressed very close by the hunters.</p>

<p>“You look like a gentleman,” she cried, after making
some ineffectual efforts to speak; “and you behave like
a footpad. I know nothing of the book you rave about.
I have never heard of the man whose name you have
brought forward—this person in the employ of Captain
Desfrayne—I—I——”</p>

<p>“You have not answered my question. Can you distinctly
say the book is <i>not</i> in that cabinet? You dare not
say so.”</p>

<p>“If a denial will satisfy you, I can safely say no book
of any kind is within that cabinet,” said madam. “Our
interview is at an end, and I decline to receive you again
on any pretense whatever.”</p>

<p>“You dare not open that cabinet, and let me see for
myself if what you say is true,” said Frank Amberley.</p>

<p>“You do not believe me, then?”</p>

<p>“Candidly, I do not. I say the book is there.”</p>

<p>“I—I refuse to gratify your curiosity——”</p>

<p>“I thought you would. Now, the question is, what is
to be done? For I <i>know</i> the book is there, yet if I go to
obtain a search-warrant, you will destroy it before I am
fairly out of the house.”</p>

<p>“You shall not have it to say that I shrank from letting
you see how preposterous your guess is,” said madam,
crossing the room to the cabinet.</p>

<p>With a trembling finger, she pressed the spring that
unlocked the doors, and threw the cabinet open.</p>

<p>A range of elaborately carved and gilded drawers appeared—a
set on the right and a set on the left.</p>

<p>“You are at liberty to open these drawers, sir. As I
have suffered your audacity and presumption so far, I
may as well let you run on in your silly insolence to the
end.”</p>

<p>Frank Amberley made no reply. He availed himself
of the permission to look into the drawers, which he
opened mechanically, pushing them back without really
seeing their contents.</p>

<p>As he drew them out one after another, Madam Guiscardini
standing by with a fast-beating heart, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
trying to recall some dim, misty recollection of a cabinet
very similar to this, which he had seen at an old country
house in Provençal during the days of his childhood.</p>

<p>He had a vague conception that about the middle of
the double row of drawers there was a spring which,
properly moved, revealed the existence of a secret hiding-place.
The spring was a duplex one, but how it
was touched he could not remember.</p>

<p>It would be useless to leave the signora now, with the
idea of getting a proper warrant to search the cabinet,
for even if the secret were to be solved, or the cabinet
taken to pieces, she would burn the volume the moment
she found herself alone.</p>

<p>Had he listened to the promptings of the Evil One, he
would have made excuses to himself, and left Lucia
Guiscardini to her own devices, with liberty to destroy
the evidence that would release Paul Desfrayne, but
with sublime self-denial, he resolved to press on to the
last.</p>

<p>“Are you satisfied, sir?” asked Madam Guiscardini
sneeringly, as she noticed his perplexed look on closing
the last drawer.</p>

<p>“Very nearly so,” he replied, moving his fingers nervously
over the fine filigree work and gilded foliage down
the sides of the cabinet.</p>

<p>She dreaded that he would come upon the spring, and
saw plainly that he was in search of it. With a rough
hand she pushed him away, crying:</p>

<p>“Enough, sir—enough! Allow me to close this cabinet,
for it contains numberless articles of value, which——”</p>

<p>But as she pushed Frank Amberley away, his hands
touched the duplex spring, and what appeared to be two
drawers slowly folded back, sliding in thin layers, one
over another, while a fresh drawer was propelled forward
in place of the two which disappeared.</p>

<p>A scream from Lucia Guiscardini told the lawyer that
he had discovered the object for which he sought. She
caught at the filigree handle—it remained immovable.</p>

<p>“Leave the house, sir! I will call my servants to fling
you into the street!” screamed Madam Guiscardini, almost
beside herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>The book once found, it would not only ruin her hopes
with the prince, but would serve as terrible evidence
against her if charged with the murder of the man
Gilardoni.</p>

<p>She had intended, Gilardoni agreeing to leave Europe,
to make a bargain with Paul Desfrayne, by confessing to
him that she had been already married at the time of her
union with him, on condition that he took an oath never
to betray her affairs to human ear, and never to seek her
in any way whatever.</p>

<p>“If you do not quit my house,” she exclaimed, trying
to stand between Frank Amberley and the fatal drawer,
“I will send for a policeman, and give you into custody on
the charge of attempting to rifle these drawers.”</p>

<p>The young man did not answer. There was no longer
any doubt that the precious volume lay within a few
inches of his hand. The confused memory of the secret
spring grew more hazy—he was almost in despair. It
seemed hard to be baffled at the moment when victory
smiled. Quick as thought, he ran across to the fireplace,
and caught up the bright steel poker lying in the
fender.</p>

<p>Before Lucia Guiscardini really knew what he meant
to do, he had darted back, and with one adroit blow
smashed in the front of the drawer.</p>

<p>The laces and handkerchiefs were folded about the
faded, ink-stained volume, but Frank dragged them out
swift as lightning, and scattered them at his feet. The
book then lay revealed, and he snatched at it.</p>

<p>Had the poisoned ring still been on Lucia Guiscardini’s
finger, Frank Amberley’s life would not have been
worth a second’s purchase. As it was, she for a moment,
in her mad rage, measured the possibility of matching
her strength against his. But the next, the utter futility
of doing anything by force pressed upon her as she
glared upon the tall, slender, deep-chested, muscular
figure before her.</p>

<p>With a low, moaning growl, like that of a tigress deprived
of her young, she glided half-blindly under the
silken archway, into the back room, and groped there
with an uncertain hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>Frank took advantage of this moment to rush to the
window nearest. It was partially raised, and he flung
it wide open.</p>

<p>The cab was still in waiting, directly opposite, on the
very spot where poor Gilardoni had stood scarce more
than a week since. The driver was sitting tranquilly on
the step of his vehicle, smoking a pipe. Frank threw the
book so adroitly that it fell at the man’s feet, and called
to him. The fellow caught up the dingy volume, and
was under the window in a second. Frank dropped a
sovereign in his hand, and said, in a clear, distinct tone:</p>

<p>“Drive with that book to eighty-six, Alderman’s Lane,
and ask for Mr. Joyner—give it to him; then wait, and
if I am not back there in a couple of hours, bring him
here. Give that book to no other human being, and tell
no one else.”</p>

<p>The man touched his hat, and ran to his cab.</p>

<p>“This ’ere <i>is</i> the very most rummiest start <i>I</i> ever come
near,” he said to himself, as he rattled off. “I wonder
whatever’s up?”</p>

<p>This scene passed in a moment. As the man was
mounting his box, Lucia entered, with the same creeping,
tottering, dragging step. In her hand was a tiny, silver-mounted
revolver. Her brain had almost given way, and
death, disgrace, misery seemed to point at her with gibbering,
skeleton fingers. Her one dominant thought was
that she must recover that fatal volume at all hazards.
She advanced toward Frank Amberley with the aspect
of a beautiful beast of prey.</p>

<p>His hands were empty; she glared about to see what
he had done with his prize.</p>

<p>“Where is it?” she hoarsely demanded, speaking as if
her throat were dry.</p>

<p>“In a place of safety.”</p>

<p>“Where is it, I say? What have you done with it?”</p>

<p>She suddenly noticed the open window, and ran to it.
Then the truth flashed upon her.</p>

<p>“You have ruined me!” she screamed, rushing toward
the young lawyer. “I have nothing but disgrace
and despair to look forward to. But if I suffer, it matters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
not if it be for little or much, and I will have
vengeance!”</p>

<p>The click of the lock of her pistol warned Frank of
his imminent danger. He sprang upon her, and tried
to disarm her. But her grip was tight, and her strength
more than he had counted on, and a short, desperate
struggle for life ensued.</p>

<p>As he succeeded in snatching the pistol, it went off.
The report brought the servants rushing to the room.
They found their mistress on her knees, her hair floating
wildly about her, her face ashy white, her arms entwined
about her visitor, who stood with the pistol in his
hand, trying to disengage himself.</p>

<p>“Seize him—seize him—he will kill me!” exclaimed
Madam Guiscardini. “He has robbed me, and would
murder me!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">DEFIANCE, NOT DEFENSE.</p>


<p>As Madam Guiscardini’s servants stood gaping in
amazement and affright at the scene before them, Frank
Amberley felt he had need to exercise all the coolness
and address left him. He had no desire, nor did he believe
that the mistress of the house in her more sober
moments could wish, that the police should be called in as
assistants.</p>

<p>“Stand back!” he thundered, in authoritative tones
to the scared domestics, at the same time leveling the
pistol at them. “Heaven forbid that I should take the
life of any one here, but I will shoot the first who dares
to lay a finger on me!”</p>

<p>The women squeaked, the men huddled back on one
another. None cared to risk the safety of limbs in the
service of a mistress for whom not one in the house cared
a doit.</p>

<p>“Madam Guiscardini knows me,” the young lawyer
continued. “She knows where to find me, if I am wanted.
She has told you a falsehood. Let me go. Stand back,
all of you.”</p>

<p>Her first burst of frenzied passion exhausted, Lucia
Guiscardini rapidly reviewed her position. A sullen
despair succeeded her fury. Certainly, it would not be
to her interest that the police should be called. This
desperate man would probably raise a counter-charge
against her, and there would be an investigation. As he
was a friend of Paul Desfrayne’s, he must inevitably
within a few hours learn the damning fact of the death
of the man Gilardoni.</p>

<p>“They will set people to work,” she said to herself;
“and they will find out that I was with him yesterday.
Not the cleverest chemist on earth will be able to trace
the poison, but they may trap me, for all that.”</p>

<p>This idea raced through her brain like lightning, so
that she seemed only to have time to unlink her arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
from about Frank Amberley, place her hands to her forehead
as if in horror, and then fall back in an admirably
simulated swoon.</p>

<p>“Stand aside, and let me pass,” again exclaimed Frank
Amberley, finding himself thus released.</p>

<p>“Seize him! Don’t let him go!” faintly cried one or
two in the rear of the group in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Attend to your mistress, and leave my way free,”
cried Frank Amberley, still holding the deadly weapon
leveled menacingly. He was as ignorant as any one
there whether the second chamber was loaded or not,
but that signified little, as he had not the most remote intention
of hurting as much as a fly.</p>

<p>With a quick, threatening step and determined air, he
strode toward the door.</p>

<p>Some of the domestics fled precipitately up-stairs, others
crawled back by another door leading into the two
drawing-rooms. A whispered buzz ran round, but no
one raised a hand to stay the supposed assailant of the
mistress of the house.</p>

<p>Pistol in hand, he walked between the two startled
groups, steadily, with perfect sang-froid. At the top of
the stairs he turned, and went down step by step, backward,
lest he should be surprised and overpowered. No
one stirred, however, though some of the women peered
over the balustrade. One of the housemaids ran and
raised Madam Guiscardini, who still remained in her
convenient swoon, while the other flew to get some water
from a side table.</p>

<p>Arrived in the hall, Frank Amberley opened the door,
laid the pistol on the hall table, and went out.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven, so far!” he exclaimed, aloud, as he
found himself at liberty in the open air.</p>

<p>He marveled how they had let him depart, and expected
to see them rushing after him, hallooing at the top
of their voices.</p>

<p>A few rapid strides brought him to the corner. He had
it in his heart to take to his heels, but did not yield
to the temptation. His pulses were throbbing painfully,
and he knew that much was yet to come, but he contrived
to maintain his composure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>With joy he saw a slowly crawling hansom coming
toward him. The driver hailed him, and he threw himself
into the vehicle with a sense of relief indescribable.</p>

<p>“Alderman’s Lane, city,” he cried.</p>

<p>It seemed scarcely credible that he should have succeeded
in so readily discovering the inestimable treasure
which had seemed utterly beyond reach.</p>

<p>On reaching his destination, the young lawyer ran
lightly up the steps, and passed into the office. As it
happened, Mr. Willis Joyner was there, reading a note
which had just come for him. He looked up, and cried
out as if in surprise:</p>

<p>“Hello, Amberley, is that you? What have you been
up to—practising a little mild burglary, eh?”</p>

<p>“A cabman gave you an Italian register just now, did
he not?” anxiously inquired Frank.</p>

<p>“He did. I put it in my safe.”</p>

<p>Arrived in the chamber devoted to the use of the cheerful
and urbane Mr. Willis Joyner, Frank seized on the
volume the instant it was produced from the ponderous
iron safe. In a very short investigation—for he was an
accomplished master of the Italian language—he lighted
on the register which was to set Paul Desfrayne at liberty.</p>

<p>“By the way,” Mr. Willis remarked, “a telegram arrived
for you directly after you left this morning. I had
forgotten.”</p>

<p>“A telegram? Did an Italian call for me?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of.”</p>

<p>Frank Amberley tore open the envelope of the telegram.</p>

<p>“Great heavens!” he ejaculated, when he had read the
few terrible lines of the despatch.</p>

<p>They ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On my return last night, I found Leonardo Gilardoni
lying dead in my rooms. I fear he has met with foul
play. On my way, I believe I saw Madam G. walking
at a rapid pace toward the station. I pursued; but when
I reached the station, I found the last train had just
started for London. I cannot help associating the fact of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
her presence here with the death of my poor servant.
Pray Heaven I may be in error in thinking so! Inquest
this afternoon.”</p>
</div>

<p>Agitated by the events of the morning, Frank Amberley
was inexpressibly shocked by this fatal intelligence.
Dropping the paper from his trembling fingers, he sank
into a chair, as if unable to speak.</p>

<p>Mr. Willis Joyner hastily poured out some wine, which
he offered to Frank, and stood by with the tender sympathy
of some gentle-hearted woman.</p>

<p>Every one in the place loved Frank Amberley, and
none probably more than the gay, superficially selfish
Willis Joyner. He saw that some very unusual circumstances
had upset the general tranquillity of the young
man; and, though he could not form the most distant
guess as to the nature of the events which had occurred,
he felt grieved.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, Frank Amberley recovered his self-possession,
and then he gave Mr. Willis Joyner a brief,
rapid outline of the strange story, translating the register,
and showing him the telegram.</p>

<p>The register was transferred to the iron safe in Frank
Amberley’s room, and he at once wrote a full account of
the finding of the prize, which he sent off to Paul Desfrayne
by telegraph. He did not allude to Paul’s mention
of encountering Lucia Guiscardini on the road to the station,
for he felt it would not be safe to do so, but briefly
said how shocked he had been by the intelligence that
poor Gilardoni was dead.</p>

<p>Lucia Guiscardini made no sign. She had played a
desperate game, and the numbers had turned up against
her. Like most women who, innocent or guilty, find
themselves in difficulties, her chief idea was to seek safety
in flight. She dared not face Paul Desfrayne, for she
could expect no mercy at his hands. Bitterly did she
curse the folly, the cowardice, that had hindered her from
destroying the evidence of her marriage with Gilardoni.
Deeply now did she deplore having run the terrible risk
of killing her real husband.</p>

<p>On the departure of Frank Amberley, she had sullenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
cleared the room of her attendants, and then sat down
to think—or to try if it were possible to collect her scattered
wits.</p>

<p>Disgrace, death, were before her. But which way to
turn?—whither fly? The idea of destroying herself occurred
to her disordered brain, but then she thought <i>that</i>
resource would do when all else failed. Money she had
in plenty. Why should she give up this fair and alluring
earth, if safety could be purchased?</p>

<p>“Even if they fix this marriage on me,” she reflected,
“and thus ruin my hopes of becoming a wealthy princess,
they may not be able to discover that I had aught to
do with the death of Gilardoni. How could they? Even
if they find out I was in the neighborhood, who is to
prove that, granting he did not die a natural death, he
did not kill himself? The excitement of a painful interview
might even bring on heart-disease. Twenty different
reasons might explain and reconcile the facts of my
being there with my perfect innocence of any complicity
in his tragical fate. Shall I defy them all, and remain,
or fly?”</p>

<p>She paced to and fro distractedly.</p>

<p>“I will remain here,” she at last defiantly decided. “If
they accuse me of stealing the book, I will boldly declare
that those three men have entered into a plot for
extorting money from me—that <i>he</i>, Gilardoni, was the
one who took it away, and that his lawyer pretended to
find it here. No one saw him take it, though he threw
it out of the window. I will swear he brought it hither,
and offered to sell it to me; and tried to bully me with a
threat of exposure as being the wife of that low-born
peasant. I will risk staying. Let them do their worst—I
think I can defy them. His highness will hasten to see
me to-night, when he finds I am not at the opera: no
doubt he will urge me, as he has so often done, to marry
him, and I shall yield to his entreaties. I will no longer
keep up my pretense of coyness and reluctance, but will
use my influence over him to hurry on the marriage.
Once his consort I am safe.”</p>

<p class="center">FREE AT LAST.</p>


<p>Evil fate, which so often favors those who wish to follow
the path leading to destruction, smiled on Lucia
Guiscardini now as of yore.</p>

<p>The inquest was held on her ill-fated husband about
the hour when Frank Amberley discovered the record of
that most miserable union that had caused his death. The
inquiry was necessarily adjourned, however, to enable
the medical men to examine the body more particularly.</p>

<p>The emotion of Paul Desfrayne on reading the telegraphic
account sent by the friend who had so heroically
sacrificed his own feelings to a stern sense of duty may be
in same measure imagined. To his overtaxed brain, the
events of these last few days began to assume the aspect
of a dream.</p>

<p>Free! Quit of the consequences of those few months
of infatuated folly!</p>

<p>Oh! it could hardly be. No. Presently he must
wake, and find it but a tantalizing vision of the night, as
he had awakened many times before, thinking he had regained
or had never lost his liberty.</p>

<p>Only too well he knew he had never loved that remorseless
woman, who would have sacrificed him for her
own worldly gain, who had slain his happiness under the
influence of her mistaken conception of his wealth and
position.</p>

<p>He wrote back a most earnest letter to Frank Amberley.
But little did he imagine how vast was the debt of
gratitude due to that noble soul. The moment the verdict
was pronounced as to the cause of Leonardo Gilardoni’s
death, he would hurry to London, he told the
young lawyer. At present it would be impossible for him
to be absent. He did not repeat the suspicions he had
touched on in the telegram forwarded by him in the
morning, for that would be but to repeat an accusation
he could not in any way sustain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>The next morning he set about making cautious inquiries,
in order to find out, if possible, whether any
human being had seen the figure that had passed him like
an apparition on the way to the station. But vainly.</p>

<p>No one had seen this woman. The porter at the railway-station
whom Captain Desfrayne had missed, remembered
a woman coming hastily in to catch the last train;
but she, he declared, had worn a pale-green dress, a
black lace shawl, and had a snow-white Shetland fall over
her bonnet, concealing her face effectually as well. In
effect, Lucia Guiscardini had made a rapid change in
her toilet almost as she entered the station, by looping
up her black skirt, changing her black cloak for a lace
shawl folded up in the small black leather bag she carried,
and changing her black fall for a white one. The
black cloak, bought expressly for this expedition, she
had hurriedly folded up, and, darting for a moment into
the ladies’ room, dropped it on the couch, making it look
as if some one had forgotten it.</p>

<p>The old woman at whose cottage Madam Guiscardini
had appointed to meet Leonardo Gilardoni was away,
gone to see a granddaughter, who lay dying some ten
miles off. Thus Paul Desfrayne did not find her, nor
did he know of her existence. The boy had departed
with her.</p>

<p>No one could throw the slightest ray of light on the
history of those hours of apparent solitude which had
been spent by the unhappy valet from the departure until
the return of his master on that last day of his life. No
one had seen him leave the barracks during any part of
the day—none had seen him return.</p>

<p>It had happened that the boy charged with Madam
Guiscardini’s message had not needed to ask for him, because
Gilardoni was walking about the yard, and to him
the lad had first spoken.</p>

<p>The analyzing doctors found nothing to justify any
suspicion of the existence of poison. Such signs as were
apparent resembled those of apoplexy so closely that the
most accurate judges might easily have been deceived.
They gave in a certificate to the effect that the cause of
death was apoplexy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>It would have been worse than useless to accuse Lucia
Guiscardini. Paul Desfrayne began to persuade himself
that he must have been deluded by his own excited imagination
when he fancied he saw her on that lonely, darksome
road.</p>

<p>At the end of a few days he was able to run up to
London. His first visit was to Frank Amberley.</p>

<p>The lawyer showed him the ink-stained, vellum-covered
book containing the brief register that would restore
some light and happiness to Paul Desfrayne’s life. Paul’s
heart was overflowing with gratitude to the friend who
had regained for him the liberty that seemed gone forever.</p>

<p>Fortune was resolved on favoring him now, however.
On leaving Alderman’s Lane, he went to the club of
which he was a member.</p>

<p>Immersed in thought, the young man was walking at
a rapid pace, when a faint, musical exclamation, and what
sounded much like his own name, caused him to awake
from his abstraction, and look up.</p>

<p>His eyes met those of Lois Turquand, fixed upon him
with a strange, indefinable expression that made his heart
beat, while a vivid blush overspread that beautiful face
upon which he had so often meditated, to the risk of his
own peace, since he had first beheld it.</p>

<p>Miss Turquand was sitting in an open carriage with
Blanche Dormer in front of a large drapery establishment.
They were waiting for Lady Quaintree, who had
alighted with the view of matching some silk.</p>

<p>It had been Miss Dormer who cried out Captain Desfrayne’s
name. The girls had hoped he might not have
heard; but his looks showed that he had done so. He
lifted his hat, and came to the side of the carriage to
speak to the young ladies.</p>

<p>The gloomy, care-worn expression had already begun
to melt from his face, and, in a manner, he was no longer
the self-restrained, cold personage he had been since the
days his misfortune had gathered upon him.</p>

<p>Before she could weigh the propriety of doing so, Lois
had allowed her fingers to glide into his: and it was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
until she felt a tender pressure, scarcely meant by Paul,
that she thought she should have withheld her hand.</p>

<p>“He is cruel and deceitful,” she said to herself, turning
away her head to avoid the glance which at once thrilled
and distressed her.</p>

<p>Some ordinary civilities and usual courtesies passed.
A flower-girl came to the opposite side of the carriage,
and addressed Miss Dormer. Paul took advantage of
this passing distraction to say rapidly to Lois, in a lower
tone than he had used before:</p>

<p>“Miss Turquand, I began a story the night I saw you
in the country. If I ever have the privilege of completing
it, you will find that now it will have a very different
ending.”</p>

<p>At this instant, Lady Quaintree issued from the shop,
followed by a shopman laden with parcels. Her ladyship
had been unable to resist some tempting novelties, and
some wonderful bargains from a bankrupt’s stock.</p>

<p>“Captain Desfrayne!” she said. “I did not know you
were in town.”</p>

<p>“I have only run up for a few hours on urgent business,
madam,” he replied.</p>

<p>“We go to Eastbourne this day week,” her ladyship
continued. “My husband has been very unwell, and
the physicians have ordered change of air.”</p>

<p>She added that they would be happy to see Captain
Desfrayne, if he chose to call at Lowndes Square before
he left town again. Some more civilities, and the carriage
drove away.</p>

<p>One long look passed between Paul and Lois—a look
of mingled feeling on his side; of inquiry, of surprise,
of displeasure on hers—one of those glances that serve
to link two souls together, be it for good, be it for evil.</p>

<p>It left the young girl trembling, perplexed, agitated,
more than any words could have done.</p>

<p>It told Paul Desfrayne that he had never loved till
now, despite that one terrible caprice of fancy and flattered
vanity.</p>

<p>But the hopes, the desires, the incipient love he had not
dared to cherish the last time he had seen this angelic
creature, this beautiful, pure English girl, who seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
to have glided across his path to lead him from darkness
and misery into light and happiness—these feelings he
might now yield to without sin.</p>

<p>The air seemed full of golden haze, and even the somber
figure of Lucia Guiscardini could scarce dim the
brightness of the day-dream that surrounded him.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">LUCIA’S TEARS.</p>


<p>Lucia Guiscardini had started by the night mail for
Paris.</p>

<p>The next morning was the one fixed for her marriage,
arranged to take place as quietly as possible at the Russian
embassy.</p>

<p>Fatigued, nay, utterly exhausted, she slept heavily for
some hours after her arrival at her apartments in the
Rue Saint Honoré.</p>

<p>When Finette came to arouse her, according to orders,
she was lying like one in a stupor, and it was with the
greatest difficulty the girl could wake her.</p>

<p>“It is almost a pity not to let her sleep as long as she
may,” thought the maid, as she stood by her, looking
down at the flushed face and uneasy attitude of her slumbering
mistress.</p>

<p>Finette had no great reason to care much for the overbearing,
capricious prima donna, but she could perceive
that she was struggling against impending illness, and
she felt sorry she should not be at her best on her
wedding-day.</p>

<p>“Madam!” said Finette. “Awake! It is nearly eight
o’clock, and your bath is ready.”</p>

<p>A shuddering sigh, and then Lucia relapsed into her
lethargic state again, though she was evidently suffering
from the visitation of some painful dream.</p>

<p>“Madam!” again urged Finette. “It is your wedding-day.
Rouse, then. It is a glorious day—the sunshine
bright and golden, scarce a cloud in the blue sky.”</p>

<p>She pressed the soft, rounded shoulder of her mistress,
and shook her with a firm yet gentle hand. For madam
had given imperative orders the preceding night that she
must be awakened immediately after eight o’clock, if not
before. The entire responsibility of this lay with Finette,
for she had no other attendant with her.</p>

<p>A stifled scream broke from the half-parched lips of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
the sleeper, and she sprang up, throwing her hands forward,
as if to defend herself.</p>

<p>“No—no—no!” she shrieked. “No! Ah-h! You
shall not take me. I have not done it. Take your hands
off——”</p>

<p>“Madam, it is I—Finette. Do not be alarmed. Pray
calm yourself. The people in the house will be frightened.
You have been dreaming. It is your wedding-day.”</p>

<p>The smooth, reassuring tones brought back the Italian’s
scattered senses, and the light of reason to her brilliant,
distended eyes. She turned her glance on the
young girl standing by, and sank back, shuddering, gasping
for breath, almost on the verge of hysterics.</p>

<p>“I believe—I—was dreaming. Oh, Heaven! what a
horrid, awful dream!” She covered her face with her
hands, with a sobbing breath. “I am scarcely awake
now. I feel so—so tired.”</p>

<p>“Your journey has fatigued you, madam. Why, you
have had only a few hours’ rest, though you slept a little
in the train. Come, I suppose madam must make an
exertion, and rise. I will order the coffee.”</p>

<p>“Why do you wish me to get up? Oh! my head aches
so fearfully—at the back, Finette.”</p>

<p>“Madam forgets it is her wedding-day. I am sorry
madam’s head is so bad,” said Finette.</p>

<p>“<i>Bon Dieu!</i> my wedding-day!” cried Lucia, again
starting up. “I had forgotten. Give me my wrapper.”</p>

<p>Finette gave her the richly embroidered silken wrapper,
and then went out to give directions about madam’s
coffee.</p>

<p>Lucia threw on her wrapper, and got out of bed. A
few tottering steps, and she fell back, flinging her arms
on the coverlet in blank despair.</p>

<p>“I believe I am going to be ill,” she cried, aloud.
“But I must not be ill until I have been made a princess.
Oh! this sickening pain in my head. But I must
not give way at the last, after daring so much. What
folly! It is simply fatigue. I ought not to have stayed
there till the last moment, and then taken such a hurried
flight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>She lay in a half-stupefied state, however, making no
effort to raise herself, as if she felt it would be useless.
Then hot, blinding tears of rage and despair began to
rain over her arms, on which she rested.</p>

<p>So absorbed was the unhappy creature by her terrors
and doubts, her feeling of physical exhaustion, her dread
lest her forces should fail her at the last, that she did
not notice the return of Finette.</p>

<p>The girl stood on the snow-white, fleecy rug just inside
the door, in an attitude and with an expression which
showed that she was utterly confounded by the scene
before her.</p>

<p>Madam had been in all varieties of humors—in violent,
stormy frenzies of rage, sullen, depressed, ill-humored,
exhausted, wearied—but never before like this.</p>

<p>Finette’s idea was natural, and yet, hitherto, undreamed
of, for her lady had seemed, if not the least in love with
her handsome prince, certainly pleased and eager to welcome
him.</p>

<p>“She does not like him,” thought the waiting-maid,
“and is only going to marry him for his money and his
title; perhaps she likes somebody else. But it will never
do for her to go on in this way.”</p>

<p>The girl was pleased at the prospective vision of being
confidential maid to a rich princess—the position would
offer so many advantages in addition to the increase of
social dignity. It ill-suited her that the marriage should
be put off, and she was superstitious enough to regard
as most unlucky a postponement of the wedding-day.</p>

<p>It was not until she was close beside her that Lucia
gave any sign of being aroused.</p>

<p>“Come, madam’s nerves are giving way,” said Finette
smilingly. “Time is flying, and madam knows how long
it takes to dress. Sit in this great easy chair, and steady
yourself, while I brush out your hair. Come, they say
people always fall into a terrible way just before they
get married, though when the dreadful words have been
spoken by the clergyman, they begin to laugh at themselves
for being so silly. It is quite proper to cry on one’s
wedding-day, madam.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>She lent the support of her youthful arm to Lucia, who
rose mechanically, as if in a dream, and placed her before
the dressing-table, a fairy picture of lace, silver, carved
ivory, and gold.</p>

<p>Then she proceeded to array the bride, who exerted
herself when desired to do so, but otherwise sat or stood
like a lovely inanimate statue or waxen figure.</p>

<p>Although it was to be a strictly private marriage, the
only attendant on herself being Finette, Lucia had prepared
a toilet of the most recherché quality. A pure,
white silk, covered with rare and costly laces, a hat of
elfin workmanship, over which was thrown a square of
tulle, frilled and embroidered petticoats, proclaimed her
bridal state. With a great yearning, she had desired
white satin and a lace veil, and to wear some of her diamonds,
but was obliged to stifle the wish.</p>

<p>When she was dressed, Finette left her sitting by the
open window, the balcony of which was heaped with exquisite
flowers.</p>

<p>The girl—her only bridesmaid—went to attire herself
in her own room, which adjoined that of her mistress.</p>

<p>“What has happened to me?” Lucia asked herself in
affright. “What means this weakness, this sense of a
sudden blank? Shall I be able to go through my morning’s
work? What will happen next? Shall I live to enjoy
my honors, my wealth, my prince’s adoration? Nay,
I must strive against this pain and depression and fear.”</p>

<p>Rising, she began to walk to and fro, with uncertain,
wavering steps, swaying from side to side unconsciously.</p>

<p>Presently Finette returned, arrayed in a really charming
manner in a cloud of pretty, fresh, embroidered muslin.
In her hand was a large bouquet of the most choice
blossoms, fit for the bride of a king to carry.</p>

<p>“See, madam,” she exclaimed gaily; “here are some
flowers, this moment sent. There was no name left, but
you will guess from whom they have come.”</p>

<p>Lucia took the flowers, and put the bouquet up to her
pale face, without making any remark.</p>

<p>“See how the sun shines—a happy omen!” continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
the girl lightly, as she gathered up her mistress’ handkerchief,
gloves, and little ivory fan. “The carriage
waits—we shall be in good time.”</p>

<p>Lucia recovered her strength, and in a certain degree
her spirits. They descended to the carriage, and drove to
the Russian embassy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">LUCIA GUISCARDINI’S MADNESS.</p>


<p>The prince was waiting impatiently the arrival of
Lucia at the Russian embassy. A tall, graceful man,
some fifteen years older than his bride, with a somber
yet gentle face, jet-black eyes and beard, and dressed to
perfection.</p>

<p>A friend on whom he could rely was his only companion.
He did not at present wish his relatives or any one
of his large circle of friends and acquaintances to know
anything about this union.</p>

<p>The ceremony was gone through, the necessary signatures
given, and Lucia Gilardoni, widow of the man
scarce above the rank of peasant, child of parents hardly
equal to petty farmers, was the lawful wife of this proud
Russian noble on whose arm she leaned.</p>

<p>Exultant, yet weighed down by an inexplicable dread
of approaching evil, the newly made princess swept down
the aisle of the little chapel, on her way to his carriage.
Suddenly she clutched the prince’s arm, and drew back,
as if horror-stricken. With her disengaged hand she
pointed to a dim corner, her great black eyes widely
opened, the pupils distended.</p>

<p>The prince looked to see what caused her overwhelming
terror. Nothing was visible, as far as he could
descry.</p>

<p>“What is it, my dearest love?” he tenderly asked,
stooping to gaze into her pallid face.</p>

<p>“There—<i>there</i>!” she whispered. “He is there. They
said he was dead. They pretended I killed him. But he
is there. He is not dead—or is it his spirit?”</p>

<p>“Of whom do you speak, my own dear one?” asked the
prince.</p>

<p>“My husband—Gilardoni. He stands there, and gazes
at me with eyes of fire. Is he dead or living?”</p>

<p>She continued to point with her finger, her arm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
stretched out, her neck craned, her eyes full of a horror
too great for words.</p>

<p>“There is no one here but ourselves,” said the prince,
a vivid terror seizing on his heart with a viselike grip.</p>

<p>The others regarded her with consternation, but could
not venture to obtrude themselves on her notice—the
prince’s friend, and the girl Finette.</p>

<p>A deathly silence succeeded. The bride dropped her
pointing finger, while retaining her clutch on her newly
wedded husband’s arm, but she continued to gaze at the
phantom conjured up by her disordered fancy.</p>

<p>“He is gone,” she whispered, with a great, gulping
sigh. “Did you not see? He melted away into the shadows.
Take me away before he returns.”</p>

<p>The prince hurried her to the door, then down the
steps, and into his carriage. His friend placed the girl
Finette in her mistress’ carriage and directed the coachman
to take her as quickly as his horses would go to the
Hotel Fleury, in the Rue de Richelieu, where the newly
married couple were to sojourn in a magnificent suite of
apartments for a couple of days previous to starting for
Switzerland.</p>

<p>With a fear too deep for expression the prince watched
his lovely idol as she lay trembling within his encircling
arm. Her face was of a ghastly pallor, and her eyes were
fixed with an absolutely vacant look on the opposite side
of the carriage, but it was difficult to conjecture whether
she was consciously thinking or not.</p>

<p>Those betraying words of hers: “They said he was
dead—they pretended I had killed him—my husband—Gilardoni!”
echoed in the brain of the prince like a beating
pulse. Had she, then, committed some fearful crime,
and had her reason given way under the sting of conscience?</p>

<p>But no—no, a thousand times no! It was impossible.
With a love, a loyalty wasted on its object, he refused to
believe anything ill of his beloved one.</p>

<p>“My own—my wife!” he murmured fondly.</p>

<p>Lucia shivered, but made no response. They drove
fast, and were soon at the gates of the stately pile where
the bride was to be lodged suitably to her rank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>The prince lifted her from the carriage, and drawing
her hand once more within his arm, led her up to the
wide, richly carpeted staircase to the suite on the first
floor.</p>

<p>Finette had preceded her mistress by five or ten minutes,
and was waiting with the other servants near the
entrance. The newly married pair walked through the
bowing files of lackeys, and passed into the principal sitting-room—a
long, lofty salon, glowing with softly modulated
colors, rare china, mirrored panels, rich draperies,
and flowers.</p>

<p>The prince closed the door, and sat down on a stool
by the trembling Lucia.</p>

<p>“My dear love,” he said, with the deepest anxiety, yet
resolved on giving her the opportunity of granting some
explanation, “what happened to you in the chapel just
now?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she vacantly replied. “What?—how?—I
do not recollect. I felt very ill.”</p>

<p>“You are not well now.”</p>

<p>“No; I am not.”</p>

<p>“You seem totally different from your usual self.”</p>

<p>“I feel so—I feel like—I cannot say how I feel—my
brain is on fire.”</p>

<p>“What did you mean by——”</p>

<p>“By what?” she sharply demanded, turning on him
the full gleam of her resplendent eyes, to which the light
of reason for a moment returned.</p>

<p>“In the chapel you fancied you saw some one.”</p>

<p>“I fancied? How strange! I forget,” Lucia replied,
laughing gaily. “Whom did I fancy I beheld?”</p>

<p>“You said some very singular words, my dear love.”</p>

<p>“What did I say?”</p>

<p>But before he could speak a word in reply, her glance
became again wild and uncertain. She shuddered as if
seized with ague, and then leaned forward, as if she again
saw the phantom conjured up by her disordered brain in
the chapel.</p>

<p>“He is here!” she whispered, half to herself. “He has
followed to claim me. I can never escape him now.
There is blood upon his wrist, where——It is useless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
to struggle. I must give way to my destiny. But I will
never go with you,” she exclaimed, raising her voice.
“Never—never!”</p>

<p>The prince caught her hand, which she snatched away,
as if terrified, looking at him with a vacant eye, that evidently
did not recognize him.</p>

<p>“You shall not take me,” she fiercely cried. “I did
not do it—I swear I did not! I was not there.”</p>

<p>The prince rose, and, approaching a table heaped with
elegant and costly trifles, rang a hand-bell sharply.</p>

<p>Almost instantly the violet velvet portière of the chief
entrance was raised, and an obsequious lackey stood waiting
his lord’s commands.</p>

<p>“Send Mademoiselle Finette here,” was the brief order.</p>

<p>In a moment the girl had replaced her fellow servant.
A brief, searching glance showed her that something was
wrong; but <i>what</i> she could scarcely tell.</p>

<p>“Come here,” said the prince.</p>

<p>He placed her in front of his bride, who was now leaning
her head on her hand, resting against the stool, apparently
lost to all around her.</p>

<p>“Madam!” exclaimed the waiting-maid, in consternation
at her vacant yet wild aspect.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with her?” demanded the prince.
“Has she ever been like this before?”</p>

<p>“No, monseigneur—no, no, never. Something has
happened,” replied the trembling maid.</p>

<p>“Something terrible—something awful,” cried the unhappy
prince, in an agony of despairing love and fear.
“Do you know if anything has occurred to overthrow her
reason?”</p>

<p>“I know nothing, monseigneur. Madam has always
been so quiet in her life, although perhaps a little passionate
in her ways, sometimes. Madam—madam, speak to
me—to your poor Finette,” pleaded the girl, taking the
passive hand that lay in her mistress’ lap.</p>

<p>A dumb spirit seemed to have seized upon the miserable
victim of her own sins and crimes. With a swift
glance at the maid, she averted her head coldly, and resumed
her gaze into empty space.</p>

<p>Some crude idea had got into her dazed brain that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
would betray herself if she spoke, and she had resolved
on keeping utterly silent. The prince she had apparently
forgotten.</p>

<p>“Remain with her,” said he. “I shall return presently.”</p>

<p>He went to his own private sitting-room, and, going
to a desk, wrote a few lines to the most eminent doctor
among those who devoted their sole attention to the study
of lunacy. Then he rang for his valet—an elderly, severely
respectable-looking man, with a tranquil manner.</p>

<p>“Do you know where to find this medical man?” the
prince asked, showing him the envelope.</p>

<p>“I believe, monseigneur, he lives in the Rue de Rivoli—but
I can easily find out,” answered the valet.</p>

<p>“Do so. Take the brougham, and do not return without
him. It is a matter of life and death for me. Do not
lose a moment—but wait for him if he should be absent.”</p>

<p>The doctor was not absent. He returned with the confidential
servant within a quarter of an hour, and presented
himself in the sitting-room, which the prince had
not quitted, for he dared not go back to the presence of
his distraught bride.</p>

<p>Accustomed as the medical man was to every variety
of painful case of lunacy, his face betrayed some signs
of surprise and compassion as he listened to the story of
the unhappy Lucia’s loss of reason, but he expressed no
opinion, simply bowing as he rose to obey the entreaty of
the bridegroom that he would see the princess.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, if I stay here until you come back to me,”
said the prince, his ashy face showing only too plainly
the suffering at his heart. “I dare not accompany you.
I love my wife ardently, passionately—and——”</p>

<p>“Remain here,” gently replied the medical man. “I
shall not keep you long in suspense.”</p>

<p>The prince flung himself face downward on a lounge
as his valet conducted the doctor from the room. He began
to fear that this awful shock would end in depriving
him of reason. Throbbing pulses surged like waves in
his ears, and his senses threatened to desert him.</p>

<p>The slow-dragging minutes went on, on, on, steadily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
monotonously, and at length the prince felt he could not
remain thus supinely waiting any longer. In reality, half
an hour had elapsed from the moment he was left alone,
but it seemed like many hours.</p>

<p>Rising, he was about to go to the salon, but as he raised
himself, the portière was drawn aside, and the physician
stood again before him.</p>

<p>The sad, grave face told its own tale, but the prince
could not be satisfied.</p>

<p>“Doctor, how have you found her? What news do
you bring me?” he cried desperately.</p>

<p>“The worst. Reason has utterly fled, never, I fear, to
return. There has been some fearful pressure on the
brain and nervous system. It would be as well to have a
consultation, however, for sometimes these difficult cases
are deceptive.”</p>

<p>But his judgment was only too firmly established on
further inquiry. Lucia adhered to her crazed resolve not
to utter a word, though her frequent terror and fixed
look showed that she still believed herself closely watched
by the figure she imagined she had seen in the chapel
at the Russian embassy.</p>

<p>But she had caused a terrible suspicion of the truth to
dawn in the mind of the last victim of her ruthless ambition.
The prince reflected upon the subject until he arrived
at a tolerably correct surmise of the facts of the
case.</p>

<p>A man of prompt resolve and speedy action, he at once
settled in his mind the course he should pursue, when he
had recovered from the stunning effects of his first horror.
For a few days Lucia was to remain in her own
apartments while the further inquiry was conducted,
then he would take her to Switzerland, and there place
her in a pretty, secluded villa among the mountains,
guarded and waited upon by a trustworthy band of servants,
under the immediate direction of Finette, who
agreed to accompany her ill-fated mistress.</p>

<p>This was done. From time to time, the prince went to
see her; but she displayed the most utter indifference toward
him, and never once gave the slightest sign of recognition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>A strange fancy seized her after a while—that this
Swiss retreat was the villa and garden at Florence, where
she had pursued her studies for the stage, and where she
had lived until she made her escape, through the intervention
of Paul Desfrayne, to Paris.</p>

<p>But she always remained totally dumb. Not the most
strenuous effort could induce her to break that terrible
silence. Even in singing, which she practised with the
assiduity of her early student-days, she would use no
words, only the vowels employed in the chromatic and
diatonic scales. Her voice was infinitely richer, fuller,
sweeter than it had ever been, and frequently the prince
would enjoy a melancholy pleasure in listening beneath
the window to the dulcet waves of birdlike melody.</p>

<p>She loved to deck herself with the splendor of a queen;
and in this fancy the prince freely indulged her, though
he never employed the slightest portion of her large fortune
for this object. The horror which might have
crushed his love when he was forced to believe that she
might have committed the crime of which she had accused
herself was tempered by the most profound pity
for her distraught state.</p>

<p>Happily, no other love came to make the life of this
betrayed man a burden to him, therefore the chains with
which he had been so treacherously bound did not gall as
they might have done.</p>

<p>A few were trusted with the terrible secret of Lucia’s
loss of reason—the director of the London opera-house,
and one or two others.</p>

<p>When the emissaries of justice came to seek for her—to
accuse her of her sacrilegious theft, they found her
forever beyond the reach of earthly law.</p>

<p>The Supreme Judge had seen fit to allot her a punishment
before which her accusers drew back in solemn awe
and dread.</p>

<p>Thus ended the race upon which the lovely and gifted
Lucia Guiscardini had entered with such a high heart
and iron nerve.</p>

<p class="center">THE SOUND OF WEDDING-BELLS.</p>


<p>It was a bright day at the seashore, and the beach was
crowded.</p>

<p>Lord and Lady Quaintree were at Eastbourne, with
the Honorable Gerald and “the two girls,” as Lois and
Blanche were affectionately designated. Frank Amberley
had come to spend his few weeks of holiday here.</p>

<p>Paul, by the advice of his colonel, had seen the Italian
consul in London. The consul had looked grave,
listened to his story, received the register, and said:</p>

<p>“The matter shall have every attention, and in all probability
we shall communicate with you shortly respecting
it.”</p>

<p>Some months, after all, elapsed before Captain Desfrayne
received any communication, and then he learned
the painful facts of the unhappy Lucia’s third marriage
and the loss of her reason.</p>

<p>He made every effort to find her on settling the affair
at the Italian consulate—but vainly, and was obliged to
relinquish the attempt. Then he repaired to Eastbourne.
The agitation of these last few weeks had told terribly
on his health, although he was rejoicing with unspeakable
joy over his recovered liberty.</p>

<p>He knew that the Quaintrees had chosen the place; indeed,
that had been the attraction for him. And Frank
Amberley had seen him during his visit to London, and
mentioned his intention of coming.</p>

<p>Captain Desfrayne set off to pay a visit of ceremony to
Lady Quaintree.</p>

<p>On the way, however, the scene was so bright, so alluring,
so unlike what he had been condemned to for
some time, that he paused to contemplate it.</p>

<p>How many minutes he lingered he did not know, but
he was aroused from a bitter-sweet day-dream by hearing
some one address him by name. It was Frank Amberley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>The young lawyer had left a party seated on the beach
to come and intercept Paul; but returned to them, followed
by his treasure-trove.</p>

<p>Paul’s heart beat violently, for he perceived Lois
Turquand, dazzlingly beautiful as a sea-nymph. He
knew not what he said, either to the ladies or to Lord
Quaintree and his son, and sat down mechanically when
Blanche moved a little to make room for him on the
beach.</p>

<p>The remarks, the replies, the notes, and queries, were
all commonplace enough, so Paul could keep up a show
of attention without betraying his abstracted state of
mind.</p>

<p>“Charming, indeed,” he had just returned, to an observation
of Lady Quaintree’s—Lois was absolutely silent.</p>

<p>Frank Amberley, too loyal to gain any advantage by
treachery, would have explained to Lois that the sad
story he told her had ended less tragically than it threatened
to do; but he had not yet found any opportunity of
speaking to Miss Turquand undisturbed. He had, in
fact, preceded Captain Desfrayne by only a couple of
days.</p>

<p>Gerald had continued to devote himself to Blanche, in
spite of his mother’s evidences of displeasure. Lady
Quaintree had begun to despair of being able to secure
Lois as a daughter-in-law. Blanche was amused by the
little flirtation into which Gerald had drawn her, but she
cared not a straw for him; while the grave, handsome
face, the soft, musical accents of Frank Amberley began
to dangerously haunt her dreams.</p>

<p>The little party rose, and Paul Desfrayne accompanied
them a short way. For part of the time he found himself
lingering behind the others, with Miss Turquand.</p>

<p>An almost irrepressible desire to confide in her rose
in his heart; but he crushed the wish, for this was neither
the time nor place. A few impetuous words, however,
gave her an inkling of the change that had come to him,
and she glanced up at him. A look of passionate admiration—of
dawning love—made her blush deeply and avert
her head, and hurry a few steps to rejoin the others. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
when they were about to part, she gave him her hand
with a little happy smile of confidence.</p>

<p>The tranquil, sunlit days glided by, and lengthened
into weeks.</p>

<p>Frank Amberley, fully conscious of the risk to his
peace involved by lingering, could not tear himself away.
But by degrees he discovered the charm, the beauty, the
sweetness of the innocent Blanche’s character, so was in
a fair way of being consoled. Happily for himself, he
was not one of those who love but once and forever.</p>

<p>Paul Desfrayne did not tell his painful story all at
once, and Lois spared him much of the distress involved
in the recital, but by degrees she became aware of all the
sad details; and she gave him all the pity and sympathy
of her fresh young heart.</p>

<p>The Honorable Gerald found some one more appreciative
and more warmly disposed in his favor than the
pretty Blanche, and transferred all the devotion he had
to offer to the more accessible divinity.</p>

<p>Paul was left pretty much to his own devices in winning
the prize held out to him so strangely.</p>

<p>It was not a difficult task. Never did wooing prosper
more hopefully.</p>

<p>The last few days of this brief, delicious holiday were
fast winging to the dim past.</p>

<p>Nay, the last evening had come—a soft, cloudless,
moonlit night, when the very air seemed to breathe of
love.</p>

<p>Gerald was away; Blanche and Lady Quaintree were
taking a farewell turn on the sands; Lord Quaintree was
asleep. Lois had stayed at home, for she had a tolerably
clear idea that Paul would come, and he had looked
a hope that he might find her alone.</p>

<p>The young girl was sitting in the long, flower-wreathed
balcony, the mild, silvery moonbeams falling over her
like a radiance, making her look some lovely ethereal
spirit.</p>

<p>Paul did come, as she anticipated. The dim, mysterious
light did not betray the glowing blush upon her beautiful
face, the sparkling, happy light in her eyes. She did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
not hear his step upon the carpet, nor see him, but some
electrical sympathy told her he was approaching.</p>

<p>With a soft, welcoming, trustful smile, she held out her
hand, which he took, but omitted to release. Then he sat
down close to her, yet slightly behind her chair, as if even
now he scarcely dared to believe that the promise of the
future could be true.</p>

<p>A murmuring conversation, too low for ears less acute
than those attuned by love to hear, and then Paul gently
folded Lois in his arms. Then, after a pause, he slipped
a diamond ring of betrothal upon her finger, and she
was his promised wife.</p>

<p>Vere Gardiner’s dying wishes had come to a happy
fruition, after all. And the story ended like the delightful
old fairy-tales, with a joyous clash of merry wedding-bells.</p>

<p>But this time there was no rash marrying in haste. Almost
a year elapsed, by the influence and desire of Lady
Quaintree, before the pretty bridal-party met in Flore
Hall, about six weeks before the marriage of Frank Amberley
and Blanche Dormer.</p>

<p>The echoes of the harmonious wedding-bells sound as
yet through the wedded life of Paul and his true love.
Adieu, care; farewell, sorrow, for the inevitable cares
and sorrows are shared, so fall lightly.</p>

<p>Sometimes a faint cloud comes over Paul’s face as he
thinks of the one act of folly which had so nearly ruined
his life; but he tries to forget the forbidding past, and
to sun himself in the love and bright smiles of his wife
and two little angel-children, baby Lois, and her elder
brother, Paul.</p>

<p>who handles the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVELS
is a man worth patronizing. The fact that he
does handle our books proves that he has considered
the merits of paper-covered lines, and
has decided that the STREET &amp; SMITH
NOVELS are superior to all others.</p>

<p>He has looked into the question of the morality
of the paper-covered book, for instance, and
feels that he is perfectly safe in handing one of
our novels to any one, because he has our assurance
that nothing except clean, wholesome
literature finds its way into our lines.</p>

<p>Therefore, the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVEL
dealer is a careful and wise tradesman, and it
is fair to assume selects the other articles he
has for sale with the same degree of intelligence
as he does his paper-covered books.</p>

<p>Table of contents has been added and placed into the public domain by
the transcriber.</p>

<p>Due to a typographical error, an incorrect line of text
(duplicated from an earlier page) was printed on page 36
of the book used as the basis for this edition.
This has been replaced here with the correct phrase:
“never left him. What would she say when she learnt”
which was sourced from an overseas serialization of the
work under the title <i>Married in Haste</i>, with the
correct text located in the Wednesday, April 5, 1899 issue of
